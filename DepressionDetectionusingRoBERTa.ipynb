She quietly put the carcass on the side of the road, as to not be ran over by others.\\nA while later, I got a 3DS and my first game: Nintendogs. And unfortunately, it reminded me of Bugsy.

As I grew up I\\'ve witnessed the town falling apart and everyone leaving. My mom was one of those people. Being a decent English speaker she decided to move to the US in an attempt to start a new life. Before she left; she promised to me and my grandma that she will get us out of there. However, it would be years until her promise would be fulfilled.\\nMy town wasn\\'t the only thing failing to succeed. I was a bad test-taker and my grades were awful. My grandma was a regular visitor in my principal\\'s office. I hated my life and started hanging with the wrong people just to feel the sense of belonging and approval.\\nFinally, on September of 2016, me and my grandma get a call from my mom saying that she got married, found a stable job and has already bought us tickets to the United States. Our excitement was immeasurable.\\nAfter all these years I thought that I would finally stop being a loser and become a new, better version of myself. I was never so wrong in my entire life...\\nChapter 2 - Melting Pressure\\nDuring the first 2 months of me being here, my mom and my stepdad send an application to a local high school. My stepdad is from Trinidad and Tobago and has seen what the lack of education can lead to. He was very impatient with me going to high school as soon as possible. I was super stressed out. I didn\\'t know a whole lot of English; I didn\\'t have any friends over here; I didn\\'t know the culture and the expectations that American teens had.\\nBeing a bad test-taker and being pissed by the apathy that a lot of teachers had towards their students; I decided to cheat. My logic was that if you don\\'t wanna bother putting any energy in gettin your students interested - I\\'m not gonna put any energy in studying your material. Miraculously, I managed to graduate the high school.\\nNow there was another challenge - going to college. I took 6 SATs in the following months after my graduation and I failed every single one of them. After my final SAT I said fuck it and decided to join the Army. If I can\\'t work with my brain let\\'s see if I can work my muscles. My parents weren\\'t too happy about me joining, but they understood the lack of other options.\\nChapter 3 - Sweat and Sorrow\\nTurns out I suck at being a soldier as well.\\nI barely graduated BCT (Basic Combat Training) with all the minimum requirements. 1 less pushup or sit up or 10 seconds more on the run - and I would fail. From that point I already knew that the chance of me graduating AIT (Advanced Individual Training) wasn\\'t too high either. I was right. On October 2018, I got a knock on the door from my drill sergeant saying that I will not participate in the graduating ceremony (both of us already knew that, he just had to make it official).\\nThe process of being discharged is not quick and it takes weeks, sometimes months. During this tiem I met a guy who offered me to move to Nebraska to live with him and 2 other roommates. He was living with his parents, I was living with mine and I didn\\'t sound like a bad option. I agreed.\\nHe left 2 weeks before me and before he left we exchanged the numbers.\\nChapter 4 - Great Plains Are Not So Great After All\\nAfter I got home, my parents were both happy and dissapointed. There was an unpleasant feeling of uncertainty in the house that none of us liked. After giving myself a couple of days to rest, I decided to call him \\\\[the guy I met in the Army\\\\] and ask if he is still down to move out. He says yes.\\nAfter a short conversation with my parents we decided that maybe starting over in a new state will help somehow. I bought a plane ticket the same day and was gone within a week.\\nI moved in, I got my NE ID, found a job. Everything was fine at first and for the first time I thought that maybe something will finally work out. Unfortunately, I wouldn\\'t be writing this post if everything went fine. After living together for 5+ months we \\\\[me and my roommates\\\\] started to get into conflicts and disputes. It reached it\\'s climax on March 8, when my \"buddy\" started spreading rumors about me and had enough of it. I told him that if he doesn\\'t stop, bad things will happen. He didn\\'t stop. \\nThat evening - me, him, and another roommate got into a huge fight. Fucked up all of the living room, threw a couple of dishes at one another, etc. To put it shortly, after the fight was over all we wanted to do was to kill one another. I had to move out. I had to go back again.\\nChapter 5 - \\\\[present\\\\]\\nI\\'m so fuckin tired of everything. My life is a chain of bad decisions and poor executions and I\\'m so done with it.

I also want to apologize because I don\\'t think anyone should read this as it\\'s going to be very negative and depressing so back out now if you don\\'t want to feel disgusted and shameful to be a human because of this post.\\nAnyway here goes I guess. I\\'ll try to to organize this as best I can, but I\\'m in a pretty emotional state right now so it might be messy or hard to read. \\nSo I feel like either:\\nA. My parent or parents have fucked me up due to either awful parenting or non existent parenting. I\\'ve never had my biological father in my life. Just countless men that didn\\'t really care about me and just wanted my mother for sex before they could leave and move on to the next mentally unstable single mom. One of them I thought was my real father until I was 8 years old which kind of fucked with me when I found out that who I thought was my father was actually like the 5th or 6th man she\\'s been with at that point. I even called him \"dad\" for years. I can\\'t imagine how he felt having this kid he wants nothing to do with call him their father. I kind of feel bad for him looking back on it. Maybe I was just a really stupid kid and that was my fault for getting attached to someone that didn\\'t give a fuck about me.\\nMoving on though. Getting off topic a bit. More behind point A. My mother since I was maybe 2-4? Has been an extremely narcissist drunk/druggie with mental issues that has only ever cared for herself. She sure could put on a good show in front of others to make it seem like she was the world\\'s perfect parent, but once back home it was \"I want nothing to do with you, leave me alone and go play your games or something so I can drink my pain away\". This left me feeling, yet I didn\\'t realize it at the time or even know I felt this way that it was my fault that she or my real father didn\\'t love me. Why else would he not be in the picture and she wants nothing to do with me? Obviously it\\'s my fault right? I hate myself today, but feel so much love and feel so sorry for that kid back then. Sigh... \\nMessed up the post a bit so it may be out of order of how I intended it to be so sorry for that. \\nFrom a young age I feel like I\\'ve had the idea \"ok, nobody cares about you, you\\'re all that you have and it will always be that way\". All of this started fucking with my head especially when I would see kids with their extremely loving and caring parents just enjoying life like it was so natural for them. I would think \"yeah there is definitely something wrong with me. That\\'s why these kids are loved and I\\'m not.\" I\\'d see kids make mistakes or anything that kids will obviously do because they\\'re kids, and still be loved the same regardless of what they\\'ve done. I on the other hand would make a mistake or do anything kids do and it would become the end of the world. \"You broke something? You\\'re so fucking stupid! Why the fuck were you so clumsy?!\" Or \"You don\\'t want to come to church with me every Sunday to be forced to believe in something you truly don\\'t?\" \"You\\'re ruining my perfect social image\"! She didn\\'t actually say the last part but you know what I mean by that. \\nShe would tell me how ungrateful I am everytime I wouldn\\'t do something she said. \"You wouldn\\'t even exist because of me.\" She thought that since she birthed me, she owned me and treated me like I wasn\\'t my own person. She would say \"I brought you into this world and I have the power to take you out of it.\" I became very lost and confused from a young age. \\nIt also doesn\\'t help that my mine and my brother\\'s only parent, yeah I didn\\'t mention my brother yet, but he is from a different father as well so we are half-brothers both without fathers and stuck with our unfortunately biological mother. Thank god I had him and he was street smart because he kept himself and I alive. Anyway she ended up abandoning us one night when we were 10 and 14. Me 10 him 14. We were hanging out with his friends one night and when we went back home the house was locked and she was nowhere to be found. I of course blamed myself. Sigh... Turns out she just left the state without telling anyone. My brother\\'s friend\\'s mother offered us a place to stay until she was heard from and we had to live with his friend for 6 months before finally hearing that she was in rehab.\\nOr maybe it was option B: I was fucked up since birth and they never told me anything and just pretended like I was normal, but deep down they knew the \"truth\" and loved me less for it and treated me accordingly. I have no clue if there is something wrong with me to this day or not but honestly even if there wasn\\'t I feel like I\\'ve become fucked up and now something may be wrong wrong with me regardless because of point A. Either way I feel fucked. Too fucked to ever live a normal happy life. To do the things most take for granted. To find love, get a job, start a career, to live with my partner, develop hobbies, enjoy life, etc.\\nI\\'m 19 years old and I\\'ve never been in a loving relationship, yet desperately craving to be in one. I know it is unrealistic for someone like me though so I try to say \"Hey life\\'s unfair, you\\'re just one of the unlucky one\\'s. Deal with it.\"\\nI\\'ve never had a job. Fear, depression, anxiety, and insecurity, along with who knows what others mental issues I may have have prevented me from trying to get one. I don\\'t think I even meet the qualifications for a McDonald\\'s crew member. Which leads me to the next point.\\nI failed the 7th grade and dropped out in 9th. I\\'m not sure if these were because of A. Fucked up childhood and the mental issues along with it. Or B. I\\'m just retarded and I\\'m destined to live an unhappy unsuccessful life because of it.\\nI have nothing good in my life it seems. I just want to idk maybe love someone and be loved by someone. I want to fall in love, go back to school, maybe college, get a job, maybe a career or trade, and start living my life happily and free and most other things people take for granted like it\\'s just like breathing to them. But is it too unrealistic for me? Will I be alone and like this until I die? God I hope not.\\nI know I should seek therapy but I feel so fucking afraid. Like I\\'m too far gone and I\\'d just embarrass myself and be laughed at for someone like me even trying to be helped.\\nAnyway this post is getting long so I\\'m going to have to cut off some bits. I have so much more I wish to type but it won\\'t fit and may be way too long to read. So I thank you again if you read this and sorry if there isn\\'t much to go off, I wish I could add more, but there are even things that I probably don\\'t consciously remember that are still fucking with me soo..

The world is big and vast and for that there are some topics that not everyone is aware. This won´t solve your problems but can make somethings clear. \\nYou , like anyone else, were brought into this world and you embodied specific body characteristics , home environment , family , local community , physical and mental skills that you did not choose. This makes it look that our lives are not so free as we think. Everyone has a journey, a wound and a purpose in life. Anything that is alive , even if it is for one second , will impact in the universe in some way.\\nWhy would someone be born into this world and repeat the **same type of  stressful situations over and over** ? Well, like i said, everyone has a **journey** and a **wound** and a **purpose**, we need obstacles and adversities to progress towards our purpose.\\nWhat is the point of being born in your best self? What is there to achieve if i already know what i need to know? Exactly! **You are born to face certain obstacles that will make you learn  certain lessons in life so that you can progress**. You need to let go of the pain and go against the other direction, the right one. I do not mean resistance, but acceptance.\\nLife gives us the exact tools for us to achieve our unique purpose ,it presents us with our skills , when the time is right it shows us the right people and situations to progress, otherwise you will be stuck in a never ending loop.  \\nIn the end, after every chapter in your life , you will dispose what you don´t need anymore for your progress.\\nEvery living thing ,dies every day, we die every day, we dispose of the yesterday and embrace the tomorow, while living and experience the today. **It´s when you hold the yesterday that pains and stagnates people.**  \\nWe can conclude from this that **we grow from hardship and not from stagnation.**\\nAbout other people, when you see someone that has a certain opinion , acts a certain way  that goes against your way of being , ask yourself what did this person had to go through to end up like this? You need to accept that people are the way they are, but this does not mean that they have the right to do what they want. Know and love who people are , but if needed put them in their place or stop them. Don´t ruin yourself for others, just accept them.\\nAbout depression, let´s be honest, it´s ugly and highly unappealing, but there are times that you need to be thrown to the floor so that you can get back up.We are attracted to smiles , confidence, people who take care of themselves and we reject the opposite , this is mostly unconscious ,but it is in our biology.  \\nThe way you view life will attract like minded people and situations, like i meant earlier, **chaos attracts chaos , self-love and acceptance attract self-love and acceptance.**\\nThere are certain things that makes men and women more attractive , like having a good/straight posture and not being curved, shoulders down or keeping good amount of eye contact when talking to someone instead of not looking at all. Fight for yourself, get a house if you can, get a job, it doesn't matter, just fight.  \\nDon´t be sloppy , don´t let go of yourself because you are feeling down. Try and be the best version you can be.  There aren´t any heroes , princes , or princesses that will come to aid you , You are your own savior.\\nKnowing all this , specially the part about life and death , you can develop something inside of you that will protect and shield you from these bad moments and that is called **Faith**.  \\nNo i do not mean religion , i mean faith. Faith is when you understand that the obstacles you are given in life are for you to learn and move forward. When you feel that tomorrow will be better than today because your learned and let go of something you did not need anymore.  \\nFaith makes you open your arms to life and whatever it throws you.\\nLife will open the right doors at the right time for you to fulfill your purpose, believe me, but mostly **believe in yourself**.  \\nThank you\", 'text_b': None, 'label': 1}, {'guid': 328, 'text_a': 'Men of reddit, how do you cope with depression and move on after a breakup that is already months old? : [removed]', 'text_b': None, 'label': 1}, {'guid': 330, 'text_a': 'Can depression come from having strict parents : [removed]', 'text_b': None, 'label': 1}, {'guid': 338, 'text_a': 'Why you may have an \"irrational\" fear of others, and a dejected artitude: A side effect of being hit as a child. : [removed]', 'text_b': None, 'label': 1}, {'guid': 339, 'text_a': 'Does anyone ever truly overcome depression?

So I'm just gonna be black and white about my main problems.\\n1. I hate my job. I am a machinist and know it's not really for me. I have ideas about new potential careers such as obtaining a CDL but I am so convinced that I'll fail at this or any other career for that matter.

I also miss my friends and family from back east.\\n4. I feel numb most of the time. It is so hard to feel any real joy or happiness. I just feel hollow and life feels unfulfilling. I struggle with suicidal thoughts at times because I cannot imagine living like this for the rest of my life. I can't even bring myself to cry anymore. \\n5. I have so many goals I want to meet but I don't have the strength or ambition to pursue them. This makes me feel useless and like a complete failure. \\n6. I absolutely feed my own depression with bad habits but I can't seem to change them (at least not permanently). This makes me feel like I can't even change even though I desperately want to. \\n7. I feel detached from most people and have very little faith in humanity in general. I don't care for the way the world is today at all.\\nI don't want to be this person.

I love to look down on myself and think the worst, so how I deal with it is to make myself busy with life. School and side activities, part-time jobs and partying. But now that I’ve had extra time I get remembered of demons and all the reasons why I think I am a failure.\\nFirst, I get so surprised and jealous of people who have a good relationship with their siblings and nieces. I have four siblings, one of them passed away last year, and I have seven nieces. I am the youngest in my family so the age gap between us is huge since I came into the picture rather late. My relationship with my siblings is non-existing, and not because they are bad people or anything, we were just never close. I also live in another city than them which doesn’t make it easier to get in touch. I feel like I actually don’t know anything about them, and they know nothing about me. I don’t know what kind of music they listen to, what they like to eat or what their dreams in life are and same can be said from them about me. And the thing is I really do want to get closer to them, but I get so anxious around them and I can’t relax. I feel like a personality-less person who doesn’t even know how to talk to my own fucking siblings, and this fucking breaks my heart because I have this barrier that won’t let me just be calm and be myself. The only thing that helps me take down that barrier is alcohol, and anxiety and alcohol doesn’t mix well together. But I love the feeling of losing the barrier that helps me talk relaxed to people, the feeling to just make friends with the whole wide world. But the day after a night of heavy drinking comes the anxiety that won’t let me leave the bed and I won’t even open my phone for HOURS because I always have this fear of finding something horrible when unlocking the phone, even though I KNOW that there isn’t anything bad there.\\nWhen I’m feeling my worst this anxiety won’t let me open chats in messenger, the whole app just makes me anxious, the mere thought of someone wanting to get a hold of me makes me want to throw the phone in the lake and take a flight to a jungle were no one will find me. My mailbox, both email and at home get filled because I have the fear of finding something I won’t like. \\nI, like maybe most people here, feel very lonely since I don’t have a relationship with my siblings nor with my closest friends. I wish to find love, to go on tinder dates or just fall in love with someone from school.\\nBut I always tell myself that I’m not enough for anyone and that I am all too boring for anyone to find interest in me, and to go on a date and get rejected just scares me too much which then leads to me just not going on any dates at all. But I have had guys showing interest in me, but I get too scared and push them away by telling myself that we would not match and last anyway, or by going home together after a night at the club and not being able to handle the situation afterwards. And then being left with my thoughts and convincing myself that it’s for the best because I like being alone anyways. \\nFriends. I’ve met a lot of people in my life, but I’m not very good at keeping them in my life. People try to get into my life but I get uncomfortable and either ghost or get annoyed by them and just wish them to get out of my life even though they are good people. Or when I’m with people I actually do like I get scared that I am too plain and boring and not too exciting for them to stay with me. I get this anxiety and start to pressure myself to present myself in a way that will make them interested in me, kinda like if they are a crowd at a theater and I am the actor that needs to keep them entertained so that they won’t leave the salon. That Is why, if I don’t get invited to one smaller thing or don’t hear of something they all seem to know I take it so fucking personal even though they didn’t even mean to not include me. But since I am so unsecure about myself it tears me apart and I start to question myself, my worth and what the fuck I am doing on this planet. I suck at calling people or asking people how they are.\\nMaybe someone can relate, but writing this out calmed me down a bit and I hope that I will find the strength to come back to this thread and read the possible comments (if anyone actually reads this wall of text, sorry!) because anxiety. \\nLots of love from this anxiety filled blob.', 'text_b': None, 'label': 1}, {'guid': 400, 'text_a': 'Advice for people recovering? : I think I am getting better with depression.

I wouldn't mark it up as a tragedy because in retrospect it is really fucking hilarious but arguably one of the largest sources for the depression I'm currently in now. I wanted to post this on here to see if I could possibly get any advice and/or support mostly because my friends in real life keep shoveling me the same shit over and over again. Alright anyway let's begin.  \\n2016 (6th Grade Year)  \\nMy first year of middle school. I had all of the normal classes and pretty much a standard setup. I go through about let's say 3-4 months worth of school before I caught eye of this girl that I thought was pretty cute. (My mind pretty much wiped all memory of interactions so some might be out of order on a general time line). I don't remember how exactly, but I got into contact with a friend of the girl I was interested in, I'll call her L. (Fuck I can't remember anything from this time period). Anyway I think I remember using her as some Agent Garbo type shit. TL;DR I end up doing some really weird shit which I will list down below:  \\n\\\\- Playing the Knife Game to Get Pity From the Girl I like  \\n\\\\- Scratched my skin with a kitchen knife and sent a picture to the girl  \\n\\\\- Asked the girl who her next boyfriend was going to be  \\n\\\\- Winked at her for no reason  \\n\\\\- Hindu Habbibi Instagram compliments \\nI feel like I'm describing something a weird fuck would do but this was actually what I did. Jesus Christ. So 6th grade ended with some decent grades but I had pretty much no progress with this girl. I also did a naughty no no mustache man salute in band class.  \\n2017 (7th grade year)  \\nSo this is my 7th grade year and I'm back in full force. I tried asking the girl out but of course it was too awkward to even sound like a sentence. Anyway a time jump is deserved here since nothing really happens until the beginning of 8th grade year. Right now is basically an intermission to another Act. I finally got my hair cut from some ozzy osbourne type shit to Iraq War radio backpack skinhead type shit. My relationship with L got a bit closer with some phone calls. I think it was around this time where she got a boyfriend. It may sound like that relationship would've went somewhere but she was taller than me and already told me how she would never date me.  \\n2018 (8th grade year- A Turning Point)  \\nAlright the first nine weeks of my 8th grade year is what is probably a defining part of my 2010s experience. So I've completely given up on that one girl and turned my attention to a new girl, I'll call her F. Anyway I had art for the first nine weeks which put me in the same class with her. I had one of my old elementary school (girl) friends as a double agent to communicate with F too. (This is going to be a theme on this show). I barely communicated directly with F, which was completely different from my last interaction with what I'll just call Z for simplicity now. So the F relationship was getting nowhere and Z got another boyfriend. Here is where it gets interesting. Z accidentally posts her, how do I say this, naughty no clothes pics all over snapchat. This was by accident, the intention was to send it to her boyfriend. Of course I rode the bus with her and as some fucked retributive tribal warfare, I started to make fun of her. Every. Single. Day. So this got so bad that I was called down to the office one day and I was just told to stop doing it. I'm surprised I didn't get a harsher punishment. Around this point F told my double agent that she would never date me as well. Yeah I know I know my plan was perfect how could it fail? So another intermission between now and near the tail end of the year until I started looking around in my band. I find this really beautiful girl who looks like a 3D anime girl in my band on percussion. How the fuck does this happen.   \\nSo this new thing started. I'll call her G. L also happened to be friends with her too. So I suppose it's time to list some things that happened before this initial moment of realization that doomed me from the start:  \\n\\\\- I have barely talked to her   \\n\\\\- She witnessed my Heige Seil  \\n\\\\- I made fun of her a few times, accident and on purpose  \\nAlright so there was a chicken pox problem in our school around state testing time in 2019. What I didn't know was that G got chicken pox (because her parents are anti-vax so her entire family got it lol), which completely fucked all of the kids who didn't have the chicken pox vaccine. I get banished from our school in the middle of testing season which completely fucked over my schedule. TL;DR I had to take a few tests inside of the office, which may or may not have contributed to my shitty test scores that year. I come back to school and I'm so pissed that I just rant and rave about some degenerate who got chicken pox. So math class comes and I continue to bitch about it and I only had this revelation that she was the one who got chicken pox in the summer of 2019. Like holy shit what are the chances. Not only did I make fun of her those many times, act like a fucking maniac eating shit out of garbage cans and off of the floors (didn't mention that earlier did I lol), now I have just called her a fucking degenerate retard. I was going to ask her to formal but it was held during my quarantine, so I couldn't even go.   \\n2019 (9th grade year)  \\nTL;DR Homecoming is around the corner and I attempt to ask G. I couldn't even say anything as I was awkwardly standing next to her locker. It could've been worse. This one was the worst for me. It built up for a half year and then it crumbled within a day. I don't know what my friends were thinking at the time but later on they commented on how they hope something like this never happens again. Anyway this next girl I'll call her K basically fucked with me for like 3 weeks for some reason. I thought I got lucky but then I realized what was actually happening. It went from like a mild sadness to just no mans land with a nerf gun.   \\n2020 (Present)  \\nSo now in the present I am currently crushing over this Junior that said hi to me once and initiated some small talk. I've fixed most of the problems with my last attempts along with continuing to maintain our band storage units just to gain some GTA San Andreas respect points. I think this shit has contributed to why I believe everyday is a cycle. Everyday feels the same unless I interact with this one individual. Along with the fact that anything that is happy in nature does the opposite for me.   \\n I have no idea what Im going to do next, but this 3 week break that we just got courtesy of Mike DeWine should help. I hope reading this wasn't too much of a pain because I'm too fucking lazy to proofread this, along with the fact that I doubt my memory is 100% accurate since I've kind of mashed 6th and 7th grade together.

I studied my Master\\'s in this country and got a job. I work in the charity sector. I lived there for 2 years. In the meanwhile, I met the most amazing man ever, we got engaged last year in September. So to extend my work visa, the first condition was that I had to get a job that paid €30,000 a year. I got another job where I worked and I got the pay I needed. It seemed like the paper work for this permit was pretty straightforward. I filled out the form till the last section. It was about how this job was advertised. The charity that I worked in advertised it on their website. I applied for the job and had an interview and everything. I WAS NOT JUST GIVEN THIS JOB UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES. I EARNED IT. Now, what the government wanted was this job to be advertised on very specific platforms like a national newspaper and radio for 2 weeks and a website for job seekers to give them the best chance to apply for this job. \\nI asked my workplace if they would be happy to advertise this job again, I would apply for it, or if they were happy to get in touch with the immigration department on my behalf (since they are the biggest charity of that country) and try to seek some help. They out right refused. I was given a letter that said that my job contract was only valid till 14/12/2019 because that is the day my visa expired as well. They would extend it if I got a valid visa extension.\\nI went to a solicitor, he said that I would waste around €3000 on this visa application, there was only a 5% chance that would get the visa, I won\\'t get a refund on the application fees and the visa officers take this advertisement clause seriously and I do not meet the criteria. He asked me to get in touch with my workplace again and see if they\\'re willing to advertise it again. They denied again. \\nMy fiance and I don\\'t necessarily have the money to get married right now. It also does not feel right to get married just for a visa. I know it would be the easier way out but this is not why we want to get married. \\nWe decided to move to Canada in 2020. Because he is from that European country, he\\'s okay in terms of Canada visas, he already got his visa. My visa to his country expired in December 2019 and I came back to my country after spending Christmas with his family. \\nIt was one of the hardest things I have had to do, saying goodbye to my friends there, my colleagues and the beautiful home my fiance and I lived in together. I cannot get over how unjust this was. I gave this charity everything I had for the last 2 years and all fucking HR could say was we\\'re so sorry. \\nI came back home to Asia, my life here is falling apart too. My parents have lived in a love less marriage for 27 years now. They hate each other, each others families. My dad\\'s been cheating on my mom for 10 years now, we all know it. My mother has the darkest circles under her eyes and her health has degraded so much in the past few years, on the other hand my dad is progressing towards becoming a full blown alcoholic. \\nThey\\'re finally separating. I\\'m glad about it. They stayed together all this time just to raise me and my brother and because of the \"what will people say\" mentality of the society we live in. My family is falling apart though, celebrating festivals will never be the same, my brother and I won\\'t have one permanent home anymore, we\\'ll always visit our parents separately.\\nI also have to borrow some money from my father to take to Canada because what I had saved is not enough. Almost every day when my father is drinking, I hear him talk on the phone to his relatives or friends accusing me of how I have made him spend all this money, how he will never get it back, how I\\'ve made him a poor man. I\\'ve said it to him that I will start paying him back as soon as I start working. My fiance is also back in his home country, working and saving up for our move. \\nHe\\'s a brilliant partner. He came to see me in my country for about 3 weeks. He looks after me, knows what I\\'m going through and he\\'s always there to talk to me or just be sad with me. I don\\'t mind the distance between us, it\\'s only for a few months. \\nBut I\\'m hopeless about everything else in my life. We started to plan our wedding, we decided that we\\'ll do it by the end of 2021, after we have settled in Canada with new jobs and everything. \\nBut no.

We're both part time and work separately; She's in the store front and i'm in the back office, so we don't see each other much, but every time we talked it was like she took a genuine interest in me. Not just smalltalk, you know? Even with the club we rarely seem to be in the same place at the same time, but then there was this trip planned.\\nEvery year the club plans a week long skiing trip in the french alps; a couple of dozen of us on a mountain in a shitty hostel drinking gratuitous amounts of alcohol and falling over in the snow. I was looking forward to this so much. I haven't been on a holiday in a long long time. I couldn't afford to go when i was in the club those years back, but most of all i was excited because this girl was going. I saw this as the opportunity to get closer, actually get to know this girl, make sure my feelings are real and maybe make a move.\\nTonight france goes into lockdown, my trip isn't happening.\\nEvery plan i had just came crashing down, and it's not going to happen. It's kind of a wakeup call, because all those plans weren't really plans, they were fantasies. I imagined us going away together, falling for each other and starting this amazing relationship that could be exactly what i need to fill this hole i feel in my life. Reality is i'm not charming enough or confident enough, or in any way enough of a catch to make it happen so smoothly. It was never going to go that way, it was all just in my head.

Later i went to grab coffee and when i was making my way back to my office she called after me just to give a funny little tidbit about one of our coworkers. When i went out for lunch i passed her carrying something made of straw, she looked proud as punch telling me that she'd just bought a house for her rabbit. When i was leaving in the evening, she asked how my day was since i was alone in the office today. When i walked back into the store because i forgot to hand over the keys, she gave me this huge smug grin and asked what i'd forgotten.\\nLike, she seems to take every opportunity to interact with me, she once dropped everything she was doing to literally jump out in an isle and ask me a question. Maybe she likes me, maybe she's just friendly, but at the very least i can tell that she wants to know me and i've been doing nothing with it because it doesn't line up with my perfect fantasy.

So this is me sharing my story along with things that really helped me in particular.\\nFor most of my life I would have described myself as a happy, optimistic person. Good family, good friends, good life in general. That\\'s not to say my life was free of any emotional hardship. Specifically relevant were a couple of times I think I had a couple brief encounters with shorter term depression. In 7th grade there were a few weeks where I was very low emotionally. Feelings of not fitting in, some weird form of bullying. I remember being at my lockers when someone who was something of a friend came over and asked me if I was alright, and that shocked me into realizing I wasn\\'t feeling alright even though I just deflected with \"I\\'ve just been tired lately.\" That brief encounter kind of snapped me out of the negative mindset I was in. In that instance I think all I needed was to know some of my peers actually did care about me so I\\'ve always been very grateful to that person in a way they aren\\'t aware of. The rest of my middle school and high school experience was very good overall. The other brief encounter was just a random day during my freshman year of college. I got back to my dorm after classes on a beautiful Friday. So much stuff that I could potentially do, outside activities with friends, online videogames with friends from high school and elsewhere, any number of campus activities. I sat down and was just overwhelmed with this immense feeling of *boredom.* All this opportunity at my fingertips and none of it appealed to me at all. In fact in that moment it felt like there wasn\\'t anything in the world that would stop this feeling of boredom and that quite nearly brought me to tears. This actually scared me afterwards and over the next few weeks there was an uptick in me going and doing things I thought were productive and fun to make sure I didn\\'t feel that feeling again. I was not so lucky as to avoid it forever.\\nFlash forward to the start of my senior year of college. I had just wrapped up a typical summer working hard, spent some time camping with my family, and was excited to be back to classes. My friends and I had founded a new club at the university, the classes themselves were engaging, and everything was going great. A couple months in and things just started to, I don\\'t know, slip. The fun of anything I was doing just started to fade out slowly and because of this I started to withdraw from doing them. Less and less attentive with the club, less attentive with my social life, less attentive with classes, less attentive with physical fitness. By the end of the semester everything had *really* slipped, including my grades, and I just felt really burnt out on everything. I kept telling myself that winter break would be the recharge I needed. Some time to relax and refocus. Of course I didn\\'t fully comprehend my situation at the time and was totally wrong. Over winter break I had gone back home and spent a large amount of time sleeping/resting. Even when I was awake I really wasn\\'t doing much. At one point I had gone down for yet another nap and my mom came down and asked me if anything was wrong. She noticed the slip in my grades, the sleeping, etc. When she did that it made me briefly aware that something was indeed wrong even if I didn\\'t know what, but I of course deflected it to just being burnt out from last semester and trying to rest up. By the end of break I told myself that I should have my energy back to really finish strong.\\nFor the first month or two of the semester I came out swinging. I was extremely on top of everything, ahead on all my work and getting good grades on it all. Back to my normal gym routine. And yet I had this feeling that I was still just *behind* and despite how well I was doing, just unfulfilled. This was making me uncharacteristically anxious and would cause me to suddenly feel extremely tired. The tiredness led to slipping on things, missing classes and assignments more and more frequently. Eventually I had stopped going to classes altogether. Shortly after this I had started regularly crying myself to sleep, each time this happened pushing me closer and closer to calling my parents and breaking down to them. They beat me to the punch when I got a knock on my door and it was a police officer doing a wellness check because I hadn\\'t responded to my parents for awhile. I broke down on the spot. The officer was very respectful and polite and encouraged me to call my parents, and left shortly after I called them. The next day my mom was out at my university, which was no small trip as it was 1,600 miles from home.\\nThe rest of the week was a whirlwind that shot my stress through the roof. A lot of this was necessary, some of it felt overbearing. I remember getting texts from various people wanting to talk and feeling so exposed, as if my mom had just outed me to everyone regardless of what she actually told them to trigger these responses. She wanted to constantly be around me even though I told her repeatedly that I wasn\\'t going to self harm and didn\\'t feel alone (both completely true), and the lack of space didn\\'t help anxiety levels. However she also pushed me towards all sorts of necessary meetings. With the Dean of Students, with Student Counseling, with professors, with Student Health. Student Counseling, at least at first, was somehow the least considerate of my situation. I remember that meeting clearly, the lady doing the consulting talking to my mom and giving off a vibe as if she thought I was just slacking off in my studies due to poor work ethic and distractions. She did a 180 when I actually started talking about the gradual fade of enjoyment from virtually everything, voice quivering while I was not very successfully fighting back tears, and immediately recommended me to Student Health. The doctor I met with there was much more considerate and recognized the depression right away. More tears were shed, this time from fear, as I faced the realization of being prescribed and SSRI and becoming aware of just how much my situation had escalated. With consultation from the Dean of Students, I did an All-Withdrawal, packed/stored my things, and flew back home.\\nThe next year or so was a rough one, and contained the absolute lowest points of my life. I was a shadow of my former self. Thinking back to that time a lot of it was a blur of feeling empty punctuated by moments of extreme sadness. Even now, when I no longer consider myself depressed, simply thinking of them to type them out has me tearing up, and when I talk about it out loud my voice breaks and I can no longer hold back the tears. The spring/summer which was essentially \"family camping/get together\" season was very tough. Going on camping trips with the fifth-wheel which felt like torture as I laid trapped in a setting that I used to love now forced to realize it gives me no pleasure. Family events where I felt I was only showing up to show-face while spending the rest of the time holding back depressive tears surrounded by loving family and friends. At some point I had started therapy but I wasn\\'t at all consistent with it. Not because it wasn\\'t good or because I had something against it, just because depression had sapped all my self motivation to engage with it. I would still interact with friends but it was extremely taxing. It felt inconsiderate to drag anyone else down with me so I would spend a lot of what little energy I had to still interact positively with people around me. Only a few people really ever saw how I was actually feeling behind it all. I\\'m sure my friends loosely pieced together some extent of things but I doubt they had any idea of the full picture. Like knowing I was subtly lower energy or slightly down in mood, but unaware of the depression specifically.\\n Going to sleep eventually only led to dreams where I also felt depressed. Long nights of crying from the emotional pain and frustration of my situation. Constantly asking myself \"*Why do I feel this way\"* and desperately searching for a solution, hurting more and more every time I came up empty handed. Strangely enough, it was never really self-esteem involved which made it all the more confusing to me. I *knew* there were many people that cared for me, that I was intelligent, that I\\'ve had many good experiences in my life, that I had value as a person. And yet none of that mattered to me and only made it that much more frustrating to feel so miserable. There were a couple of months where I hit my personal rock bottom. I had fully disengaged from everything in my life, I couldn\\'t even muster the energy to so much as play a video game. For about two weeks things got exceptionally bad. I was never actively suicidal or thought about self harm, but during those two weeks and maybe some surrounding them I felt to be what I consider passively suicidal. I no longer actually cared to be alive. I hurt all day, and hurt in my dreams. The only relief I had was unconsciousness between REM cycles. I wasn\\'t going to kill myself, but the idea of just falling asleep and not waking back up, or just withering away to nothing, appealed greatly to me (It took me awhile to type that sentence because of all the powerful feelings it brings up even just thinking about it). For those two weeks I did almost absolutely nothing but lay in bed, either staring at the ceiling or trying to sleep. I barely ate or drank at all, some days not eating anything and the others likely less than 500 calories. If my parents came to check on me, I\\'d quickly pull out my phone and make it appear as if I was at least doing something minuscule then immediately putting it away as soon as I was out of their attention. Maybe in some way I really needed to hit this point, as shortly after began the slow climb out of the pit of my depression.\\nI don\\'t know exactly what it was, maybe just absolutely crippling boredom, but one day not long after that two week period I decided to go back and play a videogame I had started but never finished. May also be in part to having decided to be more consistent with taking my prescribed SSRI (which I had not been at that point). To me this was the moment things began to improve, albeit slowly. It wasn\\'t much, but it was infinitely better than passively killing myself. I slowly started to reengage over the next few months with very basic things like videogames and some of the online friends associated with them, with TV shows/movies, streams etc. I still largely felt numb while engaged with these things, none of it felt satisfying or truly enjoyable but it at least distracted me from some of the pain. Soon my younger sister still in high school started having late night practices multiple times a week which I would provide rides for. Because I didn\\'t want to waste the gas to drive home just to drive back down and then back again (10 miles from the house to the school) it was an easy way to work the gym back into my schedule. Soon I was being much more consistent with my therapy sessions and SSRI use. I was engaging more with my friends. As things shifted into the summer I wasn\\'t feeling nearly as low even if I still wasn\\'t experiencing any happiness. I felt stable enough to take an online class to further my already almost finished degree. To me this actually highlighted the current issue I was facing at the time. I was completing everything on time or earlier, getting almost perfect grades, and not feeling exceptionally sad or stressed. However, I was extremely apathetic. An \"A\" on a paper or assignment felt meaningless, zero satisfaction where I felt it could have been an \"F\" for all it mattered to me. This scared me a lot, and I started reading Reddit *a lot* looking for all sorts of different perspectives on life/activities, desperately hoping to find one that appealed to me. And while I learned a lot in general about many different things, the true way out of my depression came from self reflection.\\nAt some point I resigned to my apathy/anhedonia. Never feeling pleasure was a tough pill to swallow but it was considerably better than emotional pain bringing me to tears on a daily basis. Once I accepted it is when things started to drastically change, because I started treating it almost like a super power. I was just so impartial to everything that in the same vein that otherwise enjoyable activities did nothing for me, otherwise boring/tedious/demanding tasks did nothing either as apathetic boredom was the staple of everything I did. So I figured if I can\\'t be happy I could at least be productive. Took a part time job, upped my gym/fitness routine back to normal, started to live with my grandmother whom, at 93, needed constant help around her house and with errands. She was (Passed 3/4 of a year ago now) an incredibly strong woman and one of my biggest role models, and at the same time could be incredibly finicky and stubborn to the point that she would rapidly wear down the patience of her three daughters. I\\'ve always been an extremely patient person and my \"newfound\" apathy made me perfectly suited to help her on a constant basis. At some point I had also stopped taking any SSRIs (without letting anyone know), as they had helped me get out of that extreme low point but now I had my physical energy and all they were doing was giving me restless energy with no impact on my state of mind. Eventually I transitioned from weekly therapy sessions to biweekly. I stopped drinking soda entirely, not that it was really limiting my health, I just figured I got no pleasure from it so now\\'s the best time to drop an unhealthy part of the diet. While I still couldn\\'t feel pleasure and that I was largely just unsatisfyingly going through the motions of life I did feel as though I proved I was stable enough to return for my last semester of college at the start of the next year. My parents and therapist agreed with me, maybe even more so after I revealed to them that I had taken myself off the SSRIs months beforehand and remained increasingly stable.\\nGoing back out to college I had fiercely crafted a productive routine consisting of very little besides classes/studying, exercise, eating, and sleep. About 8hrs of sleep, 5hrs of exercise (Combination of yoga, weight training, swimming, and running), 3hrs of eating (To maintain high enough calories for all the exercise), 6hrs of class/studying, and 2hrs of free time per day (More free time on the weekends). Every day was packed but it was easy to keep moving as long as I stayed moving because there wasn\\'t anything that I actually *wanted* to do that could distract me. I was also going to group therapy twice weekly, and this is something that I think benefited me immensely even now. A lot of CBT along with just being able to talk and share experience with others directly that really aided my ability to feel comfortable with being vulnerable. I became aware that *inactivity* was a trigger for my depressive feelings. Because I was so apathetic, if I \"stopped moving\" there wasn\\'t really any motivation to \"start moving\" so to speak, which made the weekends the more dangerous days of the week. It was also a fine balance of trying to determine whether or not it was physical/mental exhaustion that legitimately required rest, or simply depressive/apathetic thoughts pretending to be the same thing. I had created a mental image of a physics block diagram that had all the factors of my internal motivation and how depression fit into that. Spring break almost caused me to slip out of things entirely due to the sudden week+ long void in my routine, and the after effects were still felt for a few weeks. Luckily the gains in vulnerability paid huge dividends with getting myself back on track successfully.\\nEven more optimistic, I had started to get a number of very brief breakthroughs against the anhedonia. The first one almost brought me to tears. I was finishing my last lap on the track and *really* pushed myself on the last sprint and felt a deep internal focus and drive I hadn\\'t felt felt for a long time. I wasn\\'t just pushing myself to be productive, I was pushing myself because I *wanted it.* I probably would have broke down and cried on the spot but I fought back the tears because I was still at the gym. The second time was during a night run and as I came up over a hill I looked over the town lights from above and at the big starry sky and felt the cool air and just had the brief feeling of legitimate happiness. Something I hadn\\'t experienced in over two years by that point. Because I was all alone I didn\\'t even fight the tears this time around and just let them flow as I continued my run. Another time was when I had just got done with my evening yoga and was on the way back to my place listening to some comedy online radio station. It was just some dumb joke but I actually laughed out loud at it, which stopped me in my tracks because I realized I actually *enjoyed* it. Each of these little moments were fleeting, only maybe a couple seconds, but they were so incredibly powerful to me. They are still incredibly powerful to me, I was in tears yet again just typing them out here. It truly put things into perspective for me of just how starved for happiness I was, and I clung to those tiny moments intensely.\\nThe next and maybe biggest challenge was still just down the road. While I finished the semester with a strong GPA and walked at commencement, I still had to take a summer field course. This meant no access to group therapy. Camping out in remote locations working on stressful assignments with little in the way of all they typical comforts from home. This would last for nearly two months. I won\\'t lie, it did make me quite anxious. It was testing a lot of skills I had learned prior to my two year break from school and it was a sharp change to go from two group therapy sessions a week to none while removing comfort and increasing stress. And really it turned out to be just what I needed. About 2-3 weeks in I was starting to regularly experience freedom from my depression. Much longer lasting moments of happiness as a more frequent occurrence. Anxiety driven by Imposter Syndrome subsiding as I started doing exceptionally well on each project. Not that my emotional well being wasn\\'t being tested. There were nights in my tent that I had felt very low and resulted in crying. My grandmother that meant so much to me passed away three weeks into it (I still got to talk to her on the phone that same day). And even though these challenges came at me it was just more and more proof that I could process them effectively and not get caught in a downward spiral. I finished with straight A\\'s across each section and felt *satisfaction* finally. I knew somewhere in the field course experience the grip of depression had finally loosened and I felt I was starting to get some space to live.\\nFlash forward to now and I feel as though that grip is gone almost entirely, save for in my memories. It\\'s tough to say when I actually felt totally over it. Not quite right at the end of the field course but also before the last few months where my life has actually been going exceedingly well. I do know that it will always be a part of me, an incredibly important part of me at that. It\\'s something I think about quite often, and doing so typically brings tears quite easily. But they aren\\'t tears of sadness or feeling weak, rather tears of knowing the strength that I had to fight a war with such an insidious opponent and come out victorious. I even sometimes think now that I\\'m grateful for it all in retrospect, as I am so much stronger of a person because of it. That if I had the opportunity to go back to the start and magically prevent the depression from ever occurring in the first place, I wouldn\\'t. I know my situation was considerably less severe than that of many others out there. People driven to self harm or suicidal thoughts, depression that has lasted much longer and/or that has been coupled other terrible things like abuse/anxiety/bipolar/etc. But I do think that regardless of when you find your way out of it all (And you will), eventually you\\'ll look back at it with a strange fondness for all of the strength and growth it gave you. How positively it shaped you in the long haul, even if positivity is a far off concept for you now like it was for me. To maybe help some people along this path I\\'d like to share some things that worked really well for me and hopefully they can for you too:\\n* **Please, please, please, get help!** This is not a battle you want to be fighting by yourself. I assure you that there are so many people that want to see you get better and help you in doing so. Many can be complete strangers. For me it was my direct family, my grandmother, my friends (Even if they didn\\'t know the extent of things), my therapist/counselors, and so many random people on Reddit I never even directly interacted with gave me crucial perspective on life when I needed it most. Speaking of, I would feel more than happy to be one of those people to help anyone struggling so don\\'t hesitate to message me if you want to talk.\\n* **Vulnerability.** This goes hand in hand with getting help. You are **NOT** weak for being vulnerable. You are **NOT** weak for seeking help. Vulnerability is one of if not *the* greatest strength I have taken away from my experience with depression and what has helped me the most when fighting back against it. Just openly talking about my feelings with others in group therapy was liberating, as was openly listening and accepting the vulnerability of others. When I think back to my lowest points I felt so incredibly weak, but when I think about the moments where I vocalized and shared those feelings I feel so strong.\\n* **Therapy**. Undoubtedly what ultimately got me through it all. Both one on one therapy and group therapy worked very well for me. Everyone can be different though. You yourself might respond better to one type or the other, with one style of therapist or another, with a certain personality of the therapist, with a certain frequency of visits. It\\'s important to spend the time finding the fit that works the best for you. And this fit can change for you over time. I felt like I had kind of capped out on one-on-one therapy on a biweekly basis after a certain point and switching to group therapy at 4x the frequency benefited me greatly. However I needed that one-on-one time to even get to a point where the group therapy could be beneficial to begin with. For you it might be the opposite, or it might just be wildly different. Whatever you feel comfortable with and works.\\n* **Medication.** The idea of being put on an SSRI was terrifying to me in a lot of ways. It crystallized the severity of my situation and the idea of taking drugs to intentional alter my mind was not appealing to me. I had an off and on relationship with my consistency taking them. It was definitely necessary to get out of the lower depths of my depression. And as my depression evolved so did my medication needs. If I was more consistent with my medication it might have sped along my journey. While going off of them towards the end was ultimately the right call it was admittedly quite risky to do that without consultation first and I would not recommend my behavior in that case. Like therapy, it is very important to find that \"right fit\" of medication, whether it is none at all or some developed combination of SSRIs you and you psychiatrist have determined over time.\\n* **Engagement.** As depressive thoughts would take hold of me I would disengage more and more from different things in my life. It always felt easy, even like the right thing to do, under the excuse of \"just being tired.\" In reality it was the opposite, I wasn\\'t *truly* tired, and the more I disengaged the easier it was to get pulled by depression. It was slowly reengaging with things, even if the happiness was gone from them or diminished greatly, that triggered my recovery and eventually led to moments of lucidity long term. That\\'s not to say you should just jump back to everything in your life all at once. I know that would have overwhelmed me and cause more of a backslide. Just a gradual reintroduction of things you used to enjoy and maybe some new things you\\'ve found along the way. Maybe a simple routine and some light responsibility that you can steadily add to as you feel comfortable. Things to keep you moving and not trapped in place where depression wants you.\\n* **Positive Reframing.** If I had to mark the point where I really started to fight back against depression it would be when I reframed how I thought about my anhedonia. I found the silver lining to what otherwise felt like an incredibly hopeless situation. Making peace with potentially never being able to obtain happiness again so I could then focus on at least being productive. Like I mentioned before, I became mindful of it almost as a super power. I couldn\\'t do anything to make myself happy so I no longer concerned myself with that. On the flipside I could do incredibly boring but highly productive things seemingly endlessly and not feel any different than doing something I would have otherwise enjoyed. My happiness was no longer in my direct control so I put my attention on what was, and that was productivity. \\n* **Smiling.** This last one might sound a little weird, but sometimes its the small and odd things like this that can really help someone. I was doing a lot of outside work during cold winter months and was frequently wearing a facemask. At some point I started just putting an almost loony smile on my face underneath as I worked without fear of looking like a weirdo and without actually feeling happy either. Overtime it did feel as though just doing that would lead to small upticks in mood. Nowhere near happy but it added to the slowly building positive buffer keeping me from sinking back down.\\nSo that\\'s my story when it comes to my depression, from start to end. Doing this has been something I had meant to do for awhile now, as far back as when I was only starting to truly overcome it. Some of the most beneficial things to me during that dark time was reading different perspectives of people whom had faced their depression and come out the other side for the better so it only feels right that I pay it forward now. Anything I\\'ve spent thinking about writing this, actually writing this, and shedding tears on this would be immediately worth it if only a single person finds something even marginally useful out of it all. Don\\'t hesitate to comment on this or message me directly if you want to talk. Discussing depression is never going to be a burden to me because I choose not to let it be so. I also encourage others like me, whom have made it out of the tunnel, to share your own experience. Nobody should fight depression alone and I sincerely hope that anyone in that fight right now who reads this realizes even a random internet stranger like me is rallied on your side.', 'text_b': None, 'label': 1}, {'guid': 852, 'text_a': \"Hey : Fuck I'm super depressed and it doesn't stop I cant get over my shitty X girlfriend.

For everything. Whether it’s deciding on which path to take or what letter to choose, I’ve always relied on this inner knowing that I am nevertheless not privileged to unravel. It might just be what kills me, in the end.\\nBecause with it, I never know when to stop. When to start thinking and not just acting and following and feeling. By blinding myself so willingly, I doom myself to never knowing until long after my foot missed the landing and I fall and fall and fall.\\nIt is arrogance of the highest kind. To trust so completely on the unknown and uncontrolled mechanisms of your own mind that you actually feel surprise when the answer it supplies turns out to be wrong.\\nAnd sometimes, sometimes I use it to pick at reality. *How far can I go before everything collapses? How deep can I twist the knife before my life is irreversibly, horribly destroyed?*\\nThe origins of this strange fixation is long forgotten or simply not made known to me. I don’t know when the longing for the summery start of a hero’s adventure corroded into a morbid fascination for the bitter, winter ending of a villain cut down, left to die alone and forgotten and unforgiven.\\nI cannot help the way my soul quails at the thought of pain, of suffering. But deeper still, I think a large part of me simply knows that I deserve it.\\nIt’s a conundrum, really. It’s difficult to chase that suffering when there’s so many variables at play. Far too many people who have made the poor choice of getting attached, of investing their time in something that’s always waiting to be destroyed. The trappings of family and friends and innocent hearts too quickly broken.\\nPerhaps if I had been born in a different context, I could have done it easily. Took the blade or stole the gun or locked the rooftop door behind me. It’s simple to imagine, simpler still to actually follow through. There would’ve been no regrets, I don’t think, but how could I know?\\nEverything would have lined up so easily. I was already born to kill myself; I just need the right incentive. And yet, time and time again, something holds me back. Such a terrible thing, conscience, how it keeps me caged and wanting. I’m a man on borrowed time, when is it going to run out?\\nMaybe I was never meant to survive my birth. The privilege certainly belongs to greater men and women than I—my brother and my sisters, for one. Perhaps they would have loved being alive. Loved it better, stronger, far less selfishly.\\nAngel. *Messenger of God.*\\nMary Grace. *Beloved; to thank.*\\nBryan. *Noble.*\\nPerhaps they would’ve cherished it, their names, and not grow to hate it—and the ones who gave it to me, just a little—like I have. Perhaps they would’ve been happy and sometimes I think that I’m simply the result of their frustration from never really having the chance to live. After having fought so hard to exist, mine seems like a bitter sigh mistakenly given form after they have finally given up; there’s enough spite, I believe, to justify it.\\nIf they’re with me, I’d like to say that I admire their efforts to remain. The first few years of my life were naive yet blissfuly full of wonder and hope. Far too many for a single child, sometimes, but maybe I wasn’t. I just wish they experienced their lost childhood in a better way, for far longer, before I inevitably destroyed even that.\\nLight may filter down onto shadows but definition demands that only one of them exists in a single space at a time. Where there is light, there is no darkness; where there is darkness, there is no light. Similarly, though they may occupy me for a time, it’s obvious that their hold is not everlasting. I exist too.\\nI miss their presence. They could’ve been happy and by extension, maybe I could’ve taken a little of that happiness for myself. Stored it away, deep down, for when it needs to be there before possibility becomes *it is done*.\\nI do wish to be happy, though I’m slowly realising that it’s less about opportunity and more about capacity. Maybe it’s my fault, maybe it isn’t. But then I never really do anything about it so maybe it is, after all.\\nOur counsellor said that I should stop thinking about it. Would you believe that it actually works? Of course, it does sear a little deeper, a little more violently each time but it does remove its immediate presence. It makes me laugh a little to visualise it, the sheer ridiculousness of asking someone to close their eyes instead of teaching them to turn away from the cliff’s edge.

I know that my problems are not going to be solved, I know that I can never forget everything I have been through. I will not be able to make up all the lost years, nor change the things that happened. Nothing was as I wanted, nothing was as I thought it would be. And I know that my next years are not going to be either, I will have to keep holding on and trying harder than the rest. For what? After all I\\'ve been through, it\\'s no longer worth, even if in the future i have the best life in the world. It is not what I want. All he wanted was to be happy, but it seems that was too much to ask. I have lowered it to just being calm, to be in peace. But again, I ask too much. I have no reason to continue, and I will not live because others want me to. If I live it is because I want to, I will not depend on another person. I have tried and tried to exhaustion. I\\'ve been holding on all my life. People believe that people with depression or who end their lives do not ask for help. Lie. For four years I have been surrounded by people to whom I tell my problems. Social services, psychologists, psychiatrists, my tutor, the institute\\'s educational psychologist. Four years. If in four years a solution has not been found, it is that there is not. And I don\\'t say it, they say it. His \"solution\" is to hold on. They want me to hold on for two more years like this, and then, after two years, i have to continue hold on, and work hard. And for what? I never asked to be born, I did not ask to come into this world, much less suffer all that I have suffered. Sometimes there is no solution. All you can do is hold on, but you know what? I\\'m human, and I have a fucking limit. They want me to live independently of everything I have suffered and I have to continue suffering, isn\\'t that more selfish than taking my life? Even among the fucked-up people, I am the one that is left over, I know from experience. It will always be like this, no matter where I go, no matter if they don\\'t know me, it will be like this, because I have lived it.\\nI\\'m drowning, I can\\'t breathe. I\\'m exhausted, I can\\'t take it anymore. I have no energy left, no desire, no strength. No one can help me, nor can I solve all my problems. I\\'m sunk, I\\'m pissed off, and I\\'m alone. I\\'ve already heard all kinds of messages of support, all kinds of criticism. Neither thing works. There comes a point of no return, and I have already reached it. I spend my days sleeping and distracting myself so as not to think, only for another day to pass. And for what? I know that there are good people, and that there are good things, but they are not worth it. People try not to see reality, because reality is bullshit. It is full of bad people, who screw life to the others. And are we sick? It is easier to convince a person with depression that their thoughts are wrong, that they are wrong because of their illness, that life is really worth it, that things will be solved and that a better future awaits them. That is easier than trying to educate people from a young age, and easier than trying to change bad people. Really, I can\\'t take it anymore, I go on the internet and I get sick, reading comments on Youtube, or on Instagram, or some articles. I get sick, and I can\\'t forget everything I read and everything I see. I know there are people more screwed up than me, who have less than me, who \"complain\" less than me, and still get ahead, or keep trying. I know. So sorry for wanting to die, sorry for not being able to anymore, sorry for not loving life. I just want to rest. \\nI\\'m still able to laugh, or have a good time, but it\\'s not worth it. I really don\\'t know what the hell to do, because I can\\'t take it anymore. And if there isn\\'t a solution already, I can\\'t keep waiting. And I know there is not going to be a solution. The pain and anger I feel is excruciating, and all I do is disappoint everyone. I honestly do not know what I want you to say, because really nothing you say will solve my life or how I feel, nor will it give me hope of continuing to endure or live. It is my body, and it is my life, and I couldn\\'t choose to not be born, but at least I should be able to choose when and how to die. My heart really hurts, I feel sore, I don\\'t know if it\\'s because of stress, exhaustion or suffering. The only thing that makes me a little happy is eating Mc Donald\\'s in my bed while I watch videos, series or movies. But I try not to do it too much because I don\\'t want to get fat, even though that\\'s one of the few things that gives me a little joy. The only reason I haven\\'t killed myself is because I have to get rid of my things and everything I have on my phone, and that costs me. I know that the police or my parents would touch my things and would not respect my privacy. They would care very much to find out things once I died, when in life all they have done is screw me. I have told my life to many people, professional and non-professional, nobody has a solution, or different answers.

Is anybody gonna read this post anyway? : So many questions, yeah. I think it'd be good to answer them in the order in which they are written. To introduce myself. Hi, my name is Anne and I kinda do like blueberries but that's not the point of this post, so let's get straight to the point.\\nWhat is the **point** of still living (see, I told you we would get to the point)? Many people I know have their future already planned. Which is the best thing that could happen to a person really. You just wanna know where you're going in life. What you wanna achieve. Which job you would like to do one day. Like, everyone of my friends has seemed to know these kinds of stuff for such a long time that it's kinda making me even more depressed. You see, I'm not 18 anymore. I'm turning 25 this summer. This fact is totally crazy cause I'm just way too old for someone that has been wishing to kill herself for such a long time lol.\\nWhich brings me to the second question: Why haven't I killed myself already? Great question, really. The thought of killing myself has been in my mind for quite a while actually. Ever since I got bullied during the elementary schoo, I wouldn’t make a day without thinking how liberating and relieving that act would had been. My life was so shitty at that time that the thought of killing myself one day to end the suffering became the only solution that felt right.\\nThis whole situation became so bad that I started seeing a therapist. Which, at this point, I’m quite thankful for cause if it hadn’t been for him and the pills he had prescribed to me, I wouldn’t have even made it to the end of high school. I was sooo determined to kill myself really, the suffering was just unbearable. Yet, I didn’t do it in the end. But we’re about to get to that later.\\nAnd, I mean, I am the one to blame partly. I have a really unstable personality and it surely is really hard to love me or be my friend. I generally am really kind to people and let them do any bad thing to me if that means they'll still be by my side. It is terrible doing so, I am quite aware of that. But I am often feeling really lonely because of my shyness and social anxiety, so when I start trusting someone, I really am afraid of losing them cause I know I ain’t gonna replace them that easily. \\nLike I said, I am hard to love. I don’t think I’m worth anything to be honest, so I’m always really surprised when anyone actually approaches me and seems to like me. My therapist would have been so upset if he heard me say stuff like that but that’s just how it is. I stopped seeing him quite a while ago when I thought I’m over all this and don’t need him anymore btw. But I guess that I was wrong.\\nOne day, I feel amazing and really happy about my life just to get all depressed and sad the other day (or even the same day, only a couple of hours later lol). I just let myself be hurt by people. Over and over again. Cause it's my fault. On one hand, I know it’s wrong but I just continue letting them do that. I just let my boyfriend treat me like shit sometimes. Cause it's my fault. Plus, who else is gonna love me if he leaves me, right? I just have to endure that. It hurts. But you wanna know what hurts even more? The fact that I can do nothing about it.\\nI’m too scared to be lonely. Some days, I feel like my boyfriend genuinely loves me and cares about me and everything in my life is great. Other days, I just feel like shit, starting to think that killing myself is not that bad of an option after all. It is a great option indeed, yet there’s a tiny little problem. I’m way too scared to do that. If only I had no self-preservation instinct. That shit always stands in my way. It always  felt so right to kill myself but my self-preservation instinct always stood in my way. I am just way too weak.\\nSo here I am. With no future ahead, having to be quarantined because of the corona virus pandemic, which makes my depression ten times worse. I don’t know how long it’s gonna take before I can at least leave my house, but one thing’s for sure. I feel like there’s no future for me and I see dying soon as the only option again. But I'm scared to do that. Again. \\nI am pretty sure that I'm gonna feel better tomorrow and this won't be that much of a problem anymore, but that is what scares me even more. Thoughts like this are always gonna be somewhere in my head just waiting to fire their shot (this expression is probably not used right, but that doesn't matter cause my whole life is trash). And I'm just too scared of the next time they'll come to haunt me. My life is a fucking rollercoaster and I don't find it funny anymore.\\nIs anybody gonna read this post anyway? **Excelent question**, thanks for asking. I don't know. But I feel better having written this down. I don't know why lol. But I just do. So thank you, reddit.\\nIf you did read it till the end though, please don't judge me.

My dad was abusive to us and my mum but she still believes the Sun shines out of his ass. I used to see him maybe twice a year at times because he lived in another City and fucking left my mum with 5 children to raise all on her own and she was still faithfull to him all those years. My mum made us think he was Superman and it's taken me many years to realize just how much damage he did to us.\\nWe had a very sheltered upbringing. Most of my friends were people I went to school with. I didn't talk to any neighbours or anything. Not having a father figure and being raised mostly by my mum meant that there were certain things about being a man which I had to learn from other men or didn't learn at all. I'm pretty okay-looking but my self-esteem is in the gutters.\\nOn Saturday evening, I was expecting a girl (I met her at work) to come visit me. I knew she liked me a lot because despite her having a boyfriend of 3 years, she still got on the bus. I then started to think about all the discussions that got me to that point. I had lied to this girl from the very first word I spoke to her. I knew what I was doing when I said certain things to make her fall for me. After realizing that the entire image of me she had was a lie, I had a mental breakdown, returned home and told her not to come anymore.\\nNow this is where this shitty feeling of depression comes in...\\nDuring this nervous breakdown, I started to look back on my entire life and I realized that I've been a pathological liar all this while. Currently, I'm 25, male, and as far back as high school, all the lies I had told people about how rich my parents were. I lied about things I claimed I did (just to make myself seem cooler). Now, started coming back to me and I just realized how stupid I must have looked to everyone.\\nI lied that I had been on holiday multiple times abroad when I had never left the country for one day.\\nI lied about having sex and losing my virginity (this time in University) when I really hadn't.\\nI lied to my coworkers about previously having been a boxer. I've never stepped in a boxing gym in my life.\\nThe lies I mentioned above are just a small fraction of stupid, unnecessary lies I told people. I said these lies to the extent that I started to believe them myself and they became part of me. But I'm sure as hell the people I told these lies to never did which makes me feel even more ashamed of myself.\\nI have so many skeletons in my closet when I did those things, they all seemed normal to me but these past it seems all my mistakes and stupid decisions have come back to haunt me at once. I feel extremely guilty and sad. The world doesn't need people like me.\\nNow I don't even know who I am or what the future holds for me. I don't feel a lying-ass creep like me deserves to have good, fruitful relationships with anyone... Maybe that's why my social life is complete garbage.\\nThe silver-lining to this is that at least now I know the stupid things I used to do and I kind op have an idea of how to make things better for myself. For starters, I'm going to start actually boxing because I think it will help me overcome these demons.

I have anxiety , I\\'m self conscious and I like to believe im more fucked up than I actually am and if it\\'s okay here I\\'d like to get it off my chest and talk about my life and where I am now to no one in particular.\\nI was never the popular kid. I was known but never popular. I was the kid that got picked last for sports or games, never got to play soccer with the other kids because I wasnt good enough, wasnt included in tag or hide and go seek, but I pressed on not knowing what the other kids were bullying me. I got to play lego or slap jack, tic tac toe, you name it, I played by myself. I had about 3 or 4 friends for most of primary school (kindergarten-grade 3). Not knowing how to interact with the other kids I was lonely. I didnt realize I was lonely as it was well normal for me. The world was out to get me and I let it, I had no voice. I didnt know how to stand up to myself for fear of hurting the other person for telling them how I felt. I was never taught how to show emotions or how to use them. Interpret them. I know what they look like and how they feel but showing them? Using them? You\\'d have better luck getting a volcano to spew water. But this is how I was brought up and its what I knew. Life for me was like looking through beer goggles for everyone else it was distorted and I had a fake image of what it was. Because of this I matured faster in other aspects of life. I grasped adult concepts earlier than most and grew into them. Into worrying about what others think of me, always comparing myself to EVERYONE else, not just the best or the people above me but everyone. I felt like everyone hated me and thought I was some annoying kid so I shut myself off from the world. That\\'s the first few years of life. I ran around as a \"happy\" lonely kid. As I grew up and was about 10 or 11 I learned to read people and guess what they were feeling/thinking, how their day was going n shit. I learned to feed off of everyone\\'s emotions around me rather than feeling my own. I essentially shut off my own emotions without realizing it and now I\\'m struggling with fixing it. I fed off of the kids that were happy and replicated their happiness as my own, I imitated them and copied them to feel included. I grew up like this trying to fill that big empty lonely hole I felt, i buried it deep down and (as a green swamp friend of mine once said) I became an onion, I made layers to try to hide it but nothing seemed to work. (Sorry this post has kinda became a pity party it was not my Intention, fuck it let\\'s continue) the next couple years of my life pretty much continued on like this, building my wall of fake emotions to \"protect\" everyone else from my greatest enemy... myself, I didnt trust myself to not fuck up, didnt trust myself to really connect with anyone. I lied to everyone around me and pushed anyone away that tried to get close or learn who really was on the inside. It was repulsive and wrong but I didnt know that. I would say this is when I got my first taste of depression around the age of 12. Grades 5-7 I was the class runt/Guinne pig/doormat, I was the kid being bullied. The other kids unanimously decided I was the kid they picked on. Fucking private religious bullshit school did nothing to prevent what they were doing to me nor did they seem to care hell even the TEACHERS  would pick on me. So I accepted \"who I was\" and that was the school fuck up. I tried to take their name tag and wear it with pride. Yea it worked for a bit as armor. I made myself insensitive to the bullying for the first little bit. But grade 6 is when the smack down really started to happen and I became... the germ. These kids had gotten the idea to give me the permanent cheese touch or the germ as they liked to call it. This was the tipping point for me. All my so called classmates and friends I had suddenly turned on me and I was alone. Truly alone, left half dead for the vultures to pick at. I broke. I broke into so many little pieces, all those people I grew up around people I trusted turned. I couldn\\'t touch anyone with out them screaming \"DONT TOUCH ME GERM\" \"GREAT THANKS NOW I HAVE TO WASH MYSELF\" and other hurtful shit like that. They couldn\\'t even sit in a chair I had used without washing it and sanitizing it. Okay I say I was alone but I had 2 friends, payton and dane, they tried to help they tried everything they could but the other kids wouldn\\'t back down. Half way thru the school year I attempted suicide. I had the steak knife pointed at my heart and started pushing, I drew a little blood but it hurt to much so I stuck around. I had only told dane and he kept it quite for a while like I asked him to but one day he told me that he had to tell the teacher, it wasnt something he liked knowing and didnt like how close I was to not being here. So he told that I wasnt feeling good in my head, that I was going thru some tough times due to the class and what they were doing. This teacher had 0 clue that it was happening and immediately went to the principal. Brought me with her and told me to tell her what was going on. I played dumb for so long hoping that it would just end. I didnt want to deal with it but they persisted and eventually brought dane in and asked him what was up. After he started to say something I broke, I told them almost everything. About me wanting to die, not wanting to live and how I wished everyone else would die first. I didnt tell them how i had attempted suicide. My worst fears had come true, I spoke up and now everyone hated me. They couldn\\'t bully me but did they hate me. After the whole class got a ripped a new ass hole for pushing a kid to suicidal thoughts (yes I told them I had thoughts, no I didnt tell them I tried) I came back into the class room and I\\'m greeted with silence and stone cold eyes staring back at me. The first thing this kid told me (who I thought was one of the people that I had as an acquaintance) \"You know OP fuck you, you go and cry to the principal that we dont treat you nicely well guess what? You want us to treat you with dignity and respect well how about trying to treat us that way? Next time think before you speak\". I can\\'t tell you how much this affected me. That kid got sent home for the rest of the week. This is supposed to be where that part of the story ends right? No those fuckers came back the next and kept calling me the germ, kept bullying me and bullied me harder than before. Grade 7 was a repeat of grade 6. Aging more and more I hid more and more of my emotions and just kept feeding off others and relying on them for how to react in different situations. Elementary school behind me and moving to middle school I made new friends, a new chapter in life. Friendsthat didnt judge, one guy even had the same name as me \"mysteriouslyreddited\". I started to notice girls at this point too. Two girls in particular, quinn and Anna. Quinn is a couple years younger than I had been babysat by my mother and I by her mother, they switched out as they both worked. And she, well Quinn\\'s amazing, pretty no beautiful, shes got these eyes that just, her hair... wow. And her smile (._. ) just everything. She was my first crush although quickly forgotten (we went to different schools. You know out of sight out of mind. K not like that but I hadn\\'t seen her in a while). Anna on the other had, well I can describe her similarly, but things were different with anna. They were. Easier??? Its. Well she was the girl I fell head over heels for and she knew it. We talked for hours upon hours but it was never meant to be. I continued on the same way I did in elementary school, by wearing armor and growing my onion. Anna and I stayed close for a couple years me being wrapped around her finger while she went after other guys. I got her a couple boyfriends reluctantly, I Introduced her to a couple guys I knew she was crushing on and I enjoyed watching her be with them (as i look back i was feeding off of her boyfriends emotions and mixed them with my own. Bad idea 0/10 would recommend.) And well this went as well as you may guess, it went great. WRONG. I was confused and shut off, shut down and shot down. I don\\'t remember what started a fight between us but it went on for months. It became personal for the both of us. I told her not to come to my funeral she told me to fuck off and go die, words were said damage was done and I thought I was okay with it. I learned quickly that I in fact was not okay and my fight with her had broken my armour and I was bare, everything was out and we both fell into depression because of what we did to each other. I was having more and more suicidal thoughts. I had spiraled to my lowest point that I\\'ve ever been, self harm, alchohol, skipping school, it was the worst part of my life. Highschool is the hardest for everyone isnt it?? Its not oof my bad. I was skipping school, fighting with my mothers husband, smoking pot and drinking waaaaay to much booze. The fall out of not having anna in my life was ruining me, yes I felt for her and yes i wanted her back in my life but the hatred for her at the same time was almost outweighing the good I felt for her. I cut everyday for over 2 years. I didnt know what to do, the pain felt good and brought me out of my head and prevented me about thinking about anything as long as the blade was on me. My entire depressive episode was brought on because I couldn\\'t stand up for myself or tell myself it\\'s okay or when to stop. I lost myself, lost my armor, lost everything. Or at least I thought I lost everything when in reality I was only just discovering life. I became cold and truly shut off my emotions and didnt even feed off others. I became a robot. I woke up late went to school skipped all my classes, went home played COD or skyrim and went to bed. Rinse repeat and that\\'s how I lived from day to day, month to month, for a couple years. I still haven\\'t reconnected with anna (anna if you end up reading this im sorry for the bad memories. I like to think that we still have some love left for each other but i know that\\'s false). As I lived like this my family life started to become stretched and strained. Being brought up as a christian I was told to believe in god, that hes the answer to all and just ask him for help. I called bullshit and that if he truly cared that none of us would suffer, if we suffer then why the fuck did jesus die on the cross for us? My grandparents and mother didnt take kindly to these words and how dare I speak about god in that manor. After mass one sunday i would have been like 15 we were at the grandparents and the topic of vacations came up and how I hadn\\'t been on one in years and I\\'d like to go when peeps went down to visit cousins from another town a days drive away. It was spring break and they were leaving next weekend. I inquired if I could go with them and because of my grades I was told no. I told them if they let me go I\\'d pick up the pace in school and i would try, but only if they let me go. Well my attitude needed to be fixed because the next thing I know my mother is yelling at me and telling me how entitled I am and that Id be lucky to consider even going. Me being the teen I was I yelled back. Fuck yous were exchanged. My grandfather had enough and tried to manhandle me, no fucking chance gramps not in my current state. We had a fist fight that ended up with him having broken glasses, he litterally ripped my shirt off me, ripped my necklace off and threw me into a door and him thrown onto the floor. He got up and started to yell \"get the fuck out of here, you can come back when your damn well ready to apologize until then get out!!!!\". I replied with \"well then I guess it wasnt nice knowing you. When you\\'re ready to get your grandson back track me down and tell me how sorry you are\" and left without looking back. He did track me down the next day and told me he was sorry about how he reacted and stepping so far out of line. That night after we made up and got a blizzard I went home to find my mother\\'s husband fuming because of how I talked to my mother which cause a fight with him. That was the night I lost my home, my family, he had disowned me and cast me out like garbage. Even tho that was one of my lowest points I didnt see it as a loss. Yea i was fucked but i was also free to do what I want when I want. So I started working on myself. I moved to a new city enrolled in a new school and started fresh. While I did climb out of my depressing hole I have yet to beat depression. I got a great girlfriend and living large now adays . Started some anti depressants, counseling and what not. Well now Im gonna skip ahead to why I wanted to get some baggage off my back. A few weeks ago I went out to the bar with some friends and I ran into none other than quinn. I\\'d had some pregame drinks, had some drinks while I was there. I didnt eat anything that day, was already dehydrated and alcohol should not be consumed like that while on meds. So I was already drunk, feeling great, I\\'d seen quinn once and didnt know what to say so I just smiled and \"ignored\" her. Well let me tell you it was so fucking hard to ignore her. I mean if you were me you\\'d find it impossible to. So I did what any drunk man does, i had a shot and approached her, asked if I could buy her a drink and  From what I remember we hit it off. I had a blast but tbh I was not looking for anything in her I just remembe how I used to feel but more Importantly j remembered all the fun times we use to have growing up and all the memories with her over the years. I was.. no i am lonely and she seemed to just kinda be there. So we were talking, and I looked at her and time just seemed to stop. We talked but I don\\'t remember what it was about. At one point I asked if I could kiss her. My self conscience was screaming at me telling me this was not okay but the alchohol was in too deep. There is so much that I wish I could remember about that night but I cant. I dont know what happened what I said or did. This is the hardest I\\'ve had to fight this depression in a long time and this time I\\'m worried that I won\\'t be able to win. I don\\'t recognize who I am anymore. I dont like this person I\\'ve become. I love my GF but I feel like I\\'m going to drag her down and make her depressed like me. I feel like I\\'m not good enough for her and I\\'m hurting her by being with her. I cant stop thinking about quinn but I think I fucked up even trying to be friends with her. There was a small spark there but nothing major besides I dont want there to be a spark right now, I\\'ve talked to my GF and she knows I have feelings for another. It was hard to deal with at first but after we talked about it she knows that im struggling with my feelings and that I\\'m not looking for a way to leave her. I\\'ve been on the verge of relapsing and going back to self harm. Im not crossing that line because when I do there\\'s no turning back. Im tired of being depressed and I want out but he hardest part is figuring out who i am and if I can keep all my current bridges or if I have to go out and build new bridges. Im gonna keep trudging on and finding my way thru this fucked up place we call earth. Again im sorry this was so long and all over the place, if you read it thanks for listening, if you skip over this story thanks for not wasting your time (that came out wrong but ov well). I\\'m not looking for help I just need to talk to someone', 'text_b': None, 'label': 1}, {'guid': 1370, 'text_a': 'My life story, I am sorry it\\'s so long : Hi there to all witches who take their craft seriously and really work, I am very deperate and on the brink of killing myself, there is so much to life; this I know. Unfortunately for me every door, every option, every opertunity has been closed off for me since I was born. \\nBefore I say what I came here to ask here\\'s alittle backstory...\\nBackstory - throughout my mom\\'s pregnancy the doctors were absolutely sure I was to be born a healthy baby girl, but somewhere along the line something unexpected happened and I came out not only a boy (according to what I\\'ve been told and what\\'s written on my birth certificate) I was also unfortunate enough to be born with cleft lip, cleft palette, asthma, droopy eyes(don\\'t know if that\\'s the clinical term, but basically up until I was 8 or 10 [can\\'t remember] I was unable to open my eyes all the way), and various other problems. I have always felt like I should not have been born a boy let alone live past 3 weeks (another failed diagnosis, lucky me right?). \\nMy childhood consisted of doing stuff to get attention but really all I wanted was to be liked a very hard thing to do when you are basically physically retarded and cannot talk like everyone else and constantly being reminded how you are such a failer that you couldn\\'t even be born right. Since my conciousness first made its way into this world I have found myself thinking as a girl, along with thinking how much better litterally my life would have been if I managed to get it right. My dad was never in the picture so growing up without a father has been difficult on its own, but of course I was informed my dad had the chance to come to America when I was born because of my condition, but he declined to start a new family and I\\'m sure he had other reasons. My mom always worked all the time so it was pretty much me and my older brother for some time. An older brother that constantly made fun of me along with my mom for how I talked and how I acted. My brother constantly calling me gay, faggot, bitch, you name it he\\'s done it. I\\'m sure he was unaware of how I felt inside but it traumatized me so much I am afraid of being myself. My body is not shaped how normal guy\\'s are either so I have no idea how to take that problem. At school o was labeled the retarded kid no one liked.\\nOnce I turned 11 my mom met a man, let\\'s call him D. D was/is military and I later found out they got married quick (span of a few months) to finance my surgeries because I came from a background of poverty being single parent with 2 kids (later 3). I was always treated like a pet and always had the harshest and most frequent punishments. I was always forced to do everything for everybody else. My brother had to go do something like talk to a neighbor to get the bike fixed, I had to do it, stuff like that. To this day I get asked by family to buy their plane tickets or order them stuff cause they \"don\\'t know how\". I have always been used all my life. I am nothing but a tool. As I patiently waited for the surgeries that I was supposed to get (atleast just the one to fix my nose and make me look somewhat normal) when I was 12, then delayed to 16, then 18, and finally at 19. I received the first surgery and all they did was make my life a living hell. \\nMedical history - The doctor messed up my nose and now theres a glasses size gap on the bridge of my nose, for the tip of it they put cartalage from my side [which they lied to me and took it out of under my right chest] is fat which I didn\\'t even care about having in the first place I just wanted my nose to be straight and deal with the rest later. I was put in a maxillary distractor (fancy name for cage on my head). To move my upper jaw forward so that they can reconstruct the palate (roof of my mouth) and straighten jaw or whatever they were doing I have no clue and it seemed unnessesary to me. It did however improve my speech just a tiny bit. I had to wear this crap o. My head for 4 months. Later I then made my own appointments 2 years later (22) and got a surgery for bonegraft. I am still missing the tooth implant which I cannot afford nor will I ever be able to, and I have to have another surgery on my nose again. I have always suffered from depression because of this but not only because of my unfortunate medical circumstances. (Also I have been getting pains around my abdominal area so either I\\'ve got something going on down there that shouldn\\'t be or when I was born the doctors decided it be best to stick a penis on me and call me a boy).\\nAs for the other reasons why I\\'m highly depressed and on the verge of collapsing. I was forced by my stepdad to go into debt. I wanted to go to college but I wanted to do it like everyone else, a real place surrounded by real people so I can maybe make atleast one friend and not be a total failer. Of course my luck hits home again and he forced me to go to an online college with the promiss of letting me use the money the army provides to him for school use. I agree and then he turns and days \"yea no... Do it yourself\". Landing me 16k debt that I can\\'t pay, 3k I was forced to pay (just to get my diploma) and 3k my mom was forced to pay for me to be able to enroll in classes. Before this though I was planning to join the military to get a one up on life, but apparently not God\\'s plan. Since when I brought up the idea he straight refused. I was not allowed to work or go out, I did not have an allowance or any type of money except money I got for my birthday ($20 every year, ages 18-19-20) and it didn\\'t help that I had no friends up until senior year in highschool (that summer is the only happy memories I have after leaving my home town. He was very controlling that\\'s why I feel I can\\'t do anything without the constant reminder of all the trauma I\\'ve faced.\\nI did however keep the promis I made to myself about joining the military. Unfortunately though I was not let in. After two years of waiting and providing all of the medical paperwork I was finally sent to MEPS for the Marines, finally a chance for me to straighten out my life and man up and get all these rediculous thoughts and feelings out my head. NOPE! Once I get there I take the ASVAP and score on the higher side (I know right smarts actually came in handy I might look like a retard but my mental capacity is on the higher side) scored 80. Go through medical everything good up until the physical, the doctor asks me if I always been tall and skinny (I have a very feminine body besides the lack of breasts and having a penis) I say yes, normal ok cool then I go to the eye exam and they tell me I have astigmatism in my left eye (this I knew it happened when I was about 5 or so, started hallucinating and seeing giant spiders with extream detail) I went to see if I can get this fixed they said and I quote \"the damage to your eye is so savire that we do not have the equipment required to even make a dent of progress, the best solution I can offer is to use the effected eye and hope it gets better over time, sorry but there is nothing we can do for you at this time.\" - Lasik doctor. So dream job at Marines = no go. The MEPS people tell me to try the army cause they accept pretty much anyone. I do and same thing they say I can\\'t join because of my stupid eye, gee thanks God. \\nAt this point I start thinking maybe it\\'s not meant to be and give up. \\nMy job history is halarious, atleast to me. Almost even didn\\'t get hired. First job at age 20, McDonald\\'s. Mom gets a house with my brother who got to live my fantasy of being in the military and travel the world, who then decides to mock me and make my life even worse by deciding he needs a surgery on his penis (he thought it was so curved he can\\'t have sex yet he never tried, now he\\'s depressed and thinks he can never have it and the doctor messed up, doctor also gave him circomsition) this happened during my attempt at joining the Marines. Throughout the course of 6 months he would constantly scream at the top of his lungs and say how God hates him, this is punishment, lash out at me for no reason, and make me feel not only unsafe but want to take my own life even more just to get out of that situation. Once we move into the new house this continues along with me every day for months on end calming him down explaining and telling him to be patient cause it\\'s not gunna heal right away and healing of the body depends on the mind state anyways. Because of the move I am forced to quit my job that I actually enjoyed, to transfer to another McDonald\\'s on the side of town we moved to (two towns down) I work there for 6 months before quitting because of how unfairly I was being treated, everything was my fault, I never did anything right, I was lazy, the works (even though I did mainly everybody\\'s job in the kitchen, everyday I washed the grill swept mopped multiple times a day, I would be on grill then on the table making the burgers, I\\'d go and get the 50 pound boxes from the freezer. You name it I did it.) I eventually quit after 6 months bought a one way ticket to California and said my goodbyes to my brother who called my mom crying saying I left and he tried to stop me... I was sick of his shit. I had shit I was dealing with all my life and now I have to deal with you and your problem too, (excuse the langauge but) fuck outta here with that shit. \\nI have so little control over my own life that I only spent 2 days in California before my mom told the entire family where I was and got my aunt (grandma\\'s sister so technically grandma, who\\'s also a nun) to somehow convince me to go to New York and stay with my uncle. I can\\'t believe I actually fell for their stupid guilt trip but somehow after only 5 days I was off to NYC. I told myself it\\'s probably best since there are lots of opportunities for me to be a musican. Wrong. I was basically plummited into the same exact situation with different people. Greedy money hungry aunt, no jobs, no money, an uncle who works at night sleeps durring the day, wierd daughter that turned into her mother. I had to get outta there it got to the point where she was looking through my stuff while I wasn\\'t there to find proof I could pay her $700 to stay in the shitty, stinky room they kept rabbits in. With a door that locks from the outside and a broken window, very small room at that. After two months of looking for jobs while making music simaltaniously I am being called a liar I good for nothing a lazy bum you name it that\\'s what she labeled me. I manage to get a job at McDonald\\'s again but in NY. I manage to set up the bonegraft appointment and lay on an air mattress for two weeks feeling useless and being called useless. I go back to work and then move into my grandpa\\'s room he was renting. Lucky for me he was on vacation for the next two months. Durring this time when my granpa came back j felt obligated and wanted to help with his bills ultimately giving him what little I had. 4 months pass and after much consideration and mom/brother begging for me to come back I oblige. \\nI then get a job at another McDonald\\'s in the next town over oppisate direction with the help of my old boss. I work there for 6 months before quitting because of the same drama the first time and hearing people continuously talking shit about me making me feel terrible about myself even more and with the emense parinoia I was experiencing due to smoking too much (the parinoia was about how I hid the fact I\\'m not normal and that I wish to be a girl and intricate details of my life).\\nIf you think that\\'s it well your wrong... My aunt comes to the USA on a visa and is put in a shit situation feeling unsafe, according to her. My mom is the only one in the USA she knows, mom folds and buys her a plane ticket to stay here for the time being, money my mom didn\\'t have, which is fine desperate times desperate measures and such. She stays here for an entire month and quickly realises there is nothing here, everything is far and you have to drive everywhere. The time that she was here I could have used to work on my music the 3 hours I was left alone in the house, but no. \\nEverything that she bought or well made me buy she complains and says it\\'s for someone else, complains she didn\\'t buy anything for herself and how she had to use my mom\\'s clothes cause instead of buy things for herself she bought for everyone else supposedly. She then says how she needs a phone and makes me go find one for her. After I go through the trouble of finding and iPhone 7 plus for a crazy deal ($150) which they usually go for 300-350 I go and I borrow money to go get her the phone. She then says oh... I wanted a more modern one....like yours.... I\\'m like ugh ok I reset mine give her it and she then says she will give me the 150 (my phone was iPhone X pristine condition). Months pass I still don\\'t have a job (stopped looking to focus on getting my licence), everybody keeps making excuses not to teach me, and the piece of crap car that my brother was going to pass down to me needs a new battery so I can\\'t use it, and he also decided to retract the offer before I got the chance to use it and is selling it because he doesn\\'t want to pay for it. He is not rich but wealthy $40k in the bank meanwhile I\\'m 30k in debt 12 of which collectors are being sent now. \\nDebt - borrowed money I didn\\'t have to help pay bills to not be called worthless and useless. Borrowed too much then took 5k out and ran away to California\\nThat brings me to the present day, some details have been left out as to not make this extreamly long.\\n(Side note: I have always liked girls but it\\'s more like an admiration/envy type of thing, always wishing I was one cause I always felt just wrong in my own body)\\nOk TL;DR shit life should have been born a girl, instead I came out with so many problems and mental issues along with the traumatizing circumstances I was put in and the problems still continue.', 'text_b': None, 'label': 1}, {'guid': 1375, 'text_a': 'HEY GUYS..

I'm not sure what the purpose of it really is but just wanting to put this out there in the world. Maybe I'll get some advice, maybe someone will read it and realize they are not alone.\\nI’ve started writing this so many times and lost motivation half way through. This is yet another attempt, let’s see what happens.\\nI’m a 30 year old woman, I work as a photographer for a fashion company with a degree in Graphic Design, volunteer at a cat rescue 2 days a week, and suffer from depression and social/general anxiety disorder.\\nI first realized my teen angst wasn’t just a “phase” sometime in my early 20’s. As a teenager I would do the normal things: drink, do drugs, smoke weed. I would also write a lot but this writing, in hindsight, was some of the deepest cries for help. I’ve since lost that precious notebook, but I did come upon snippets of that “poetry” in my other sketchbooks. The stuff wasn’t anything out of the ordinary - I grew up listening to emo and other such heart wrenching music - and the style was really just lyrics trying to artistically describe the dark cloud that was inside of me every minute of every day. I lost interest in that activity around the age of 20.\\nI was always a shy person. I played with friends during school, but I was never allowed to have anyone over or go to anyone’s house. As a result, I was always found by myself in the yard skipping rope alone. My parents brought me to Canada when I was 9 years old in order to expand my options for education. I was born in Russia where there wasn’t much choice at the time to do anything with your life other than engineering, medicine or teaching. In that aspect, I thank them. I was able to attend an art school in Toronto and attain my Graphic Design degree which my anxious artistic brain appreciates.\\nWhen I arrived in Canada I didn’t speak much English and was in an ESL program. In that first year, 4th grade, I was bullied for not speaking the language. Some girls quickly realized that it would be fun to put rocks (the little pebbles from the playground) down my pants while we had “carpet time” (when all the kids gather around crossed legged on the floor in front of the teacher during a lesson.) They knew I wouldn’t say anything, partly because I couldn’t physically, partly because I couldn’t mentally. Kids would kick my chair constantly as they walked by, someone even throw things at me from the back. I brushed it off, went on with it. I did have two great friends (one of which is still in my life albeit we aren’t close.)\\nThis childish bullying subsided after the first year. I went off to another school in grade 5 after moving buildings with my parents. 6th grade was split. It was yet another school (moving from elementary to middle school) and then half way through 6th grade, after establishing quite a solid group of new friends, I was transferred to a new school after yet another move by my parents. I had to start over with the friend thing and luckily I befriended a girl right away. She was also an outcast, being extremely tiny and skinny for her age and also didn’t fit in with the “cool popular kids.” Here I was laughed and looked down upon for being new, having 1 friend, and being so extremely shy. After a while I became close with another girl, let’s call her Jessica. 7th grade went by bearably with her around, outside minor incidents like having the basketball thrown at my head during recess. I was also developing extremely bad acne, so I was doomed to be the ugly shy girl for the next few years.\\nEnding of 8th grade is where the real trouble started with Jessica. She had an “in” with the cooler kids in the grade and being so attached to her, I got to hang out with the group occasionally. This is where we started “relationships” with two boys. She was with lets call him Andrew and I was with let’s call him Mike. We would hang out after school a lot and one day I brought them all over to my house. Mike took me down to my parent’s cellar at one point and where I thought I would have my first kiss, my hands were forced down onto his penis. I didn’t know how to retaliate so I went with it. Instead of a first kiss, I gave my first hand job. The next time we hung out was at the movies. I was brought to the bathroom for what I thought was a make out session but turned out to be an attempt at a blow job. I can’t remember whether I went through with it, I just remember crying that evening. I soon found out that Andrew and Mike had a bet going of who would get their dick sucked first and Jessica agreed to bring me into the group so they could use me for that bet. These things bled into high school. The rumours started that I was a slut and were reinforced with photos being distributed throughout the school. The photos were of me wearing see through mesh pants in provocative poses that Jessica took of me in her room one night when we were having a fun “fashion” night. She wore them too, although somehow the photos of her never got distributed. \\nFinally a new girl came to the school lets call her Beth and finally things seemed to calm down. We had a great friendship going and were inseparable during high school (to the point where people were calling us lesbians.) I even attended her wedding two years ago, she’s a beautiful human being. I tried my best to have a normal life. I threw myself into art. I would come to school at 7 in the morning so spend time in the photography dark room lab. I got great marks in my classes and my teachers loved me. Of course throughout this time I did the regular teenage girl stuff. I liked boys, I would make out with them. I was already well trained in the hand job department so guys learned to hand me over to their friends once they were done with me. I just did it. It made them happy. And in my mind, that made me good at it. Why not do the thing that I felt I excelled at? Of course none of that behaviour helped the growing rumours. \\nI first tried drugs in 10th grade. Beth and I would skip school, pop ecstasy, spend the day together. This went on for about a year in the 11th grade where my marks drastically plummeted. I’m not sure what the triggering factor for me to stop was, but I managed to graduate high school on the honour roll. At the end of 12th grade I met lets call him Sam. We dated for 2 years, I lost my virginity to him, but I will always remember doubting his intentions. Did he stay with me for the sex? Did he only want me around because I would smoke weed with him? It didn’t matter. I lost romantic interest in him after a year but stayed together despite us fighting because it was comfortable and a habit I just didn’t want to, or couldn’t break.\\nI got into my top school of choice and spent the first year working hard. After my break up with Sam, I met lets call him Dale. It was interesting at first. He would show up at my work almost daily and chat and finally we started going on real dates. He brought me gifts and showered with me with attention. I now realize that it was borderline stalker behaviour. He wouldn’t take no for an answer even if I didn’t really feel like doing anything. The thing with Dale is kind of an on and off ordeal. We were never fully together but would hang out often usually drinking or going on drives. I was starting to get really put off by him, but one night he insisted on hanging out. As you well know by now, I have trouble saying no. So we went to the bar, got a buzz going and then went driving. (I know how shameful it is to drink and I drive. I know first hand because I almost killed my friend during a drunk driving episode. I haven’t done it since and will never do it again.) We were in the car and I was completely insistent that this was a non sexual meet up. But he wouldn’t stop trying to kiss me, to push my hands on to his crotch, then pushing my head down, asking me to just suck it a little. I did it just to make him shut up so I could go home. I haven’t seem him since them. I refused to talk to him and eventually had to block him. To this day he tries to make attempts at communication but nothing dangerous. \\nThe truly destructive behaviour started around 22 when I began to frequent parties. At first it was drinking, and a lot of it. Then I met a 28 year old man lets call him Izack. He was a DJ and very much into the rave party scene. It was with him when I tried coke for the first time at the age of 23 or 24. Lets just call the rest a blur. I would party twice a week, heavily on drugs, go to school completely hung over. Long story short, I just managed to graduate, scraping by with a warning letter and passing marks given to me probably only out of the kindness of my professor’s heart. I loved Izack. He was older, had more experience, best sex I’ve ever had and he made me forget everything and everyone. He lived downtown in an apartment with two other roommates who also loved to party and we all got along quite well. The sanctuary of that apartment was heavenly. I would be able to spend all my time there away from my strict Russian parents. Then Izack started going on the road a lot more due to his DJ career flourishing. When he was away, I would come to his place and clean everything. I bought him a huge new TV for his room. I wanted him to come home to a beautiful place. In my mind that was me saying thank you for letting me stay with him rent free for so many days of the week. \\nAbout a year into our relationship, I went for a gynaecologist check up which was followed by a phone call saying that I have an STD. They told me to get myself and my partner into the office so we could be given medication. It was nothing overly serious, cleared up with a few pills but I had to have a serious conversation with Izack. He swore on his life that he never cheated on me. He begged me to believe him which after hours upon hours of me crying and pleading, I finally did. But I never got over the nagging feeling that something wasn’t right. So after a month of uncertainty, over the phone on my birthday (I remember that day so clearly), I asked him one more time. I’m not sure what made him tell me truth this time around, but yes, of course he slept with someone on tour and yes that is how I contracted the STD.\\nI was a complete and utter wreck for the next few months. The drugs and alcohol increased. I went on Tinder and began my first sex binge. At one point I managed to sleep with 6 different men in one week. All I wanted to do was to forget the hurt and I didn’t know how. Again, all of this is very blurry so I can’t say the exact moment that Izack came back into my life but he did. I remember going to a bar to meet him to get closure, to finally say I forgive him and that I’m moving on. That meeting ended up with me in his apartment and sex. We then got “back together”, continued the destructive behaviour until his next tour where he slept with someone again. I let that one go easily since we never stated that we were officially a couple again. I think this is where I learned how to numb my brain from hurt. I wasn’t mad at him anymore, I just quietly walked away and threw myself into my second huge sex binge on Tinder. After a few months of this, I met a guy lets call him Jon. \\nWe dated for something close to a year. This relationship was also fuelled by alcohol, drugs and parties. But at this point I didn’t want another life. The relationship involved me crying almost every day at work with something abusive he may have said to me that day. For example, he loved to make me feel like an idiot for asking him why it took him hours to answer a text massage. I was told I was crazy on an almost daily basis. I will fast forward to the end, where a girl (who is now a friend) reached out to me saying that she was also dating Jon, for 6 months now. She spotted us at a party kissing, and lost her mind. Apparently she had no knowledge of me for the long while they were together. It turns out, that we weren’t the only ones. I came to the knowledge that he had slept with 8 different people during the span of being with me. This included his upstairs neighbour who I was constantly told not to worry about. \\nI laughed at this. I didn’t cry, I didn’t feel angry, I laughed, pulled out my phone and on to the next Tinder binge I went.\\nIt took me about 6 months to get into my next relationship. This one was with a kind man who would never do a thing to hurt me. It lasted for about 2 years. I met his parents and he met mine. We were talking about marriage and moving in together but it ended up falling apart during our search for an apartment. We just weren’t right for each other.\\nSo this is where I am now. 30 years old, living back with my parents. I have since stopped the partying because that life doesn’t satisfy me anymore and my body can’t handle it. I have been coke free for about a year now mainly because I can’t afford it. But I drink. I drink several times a week because I can’t stand my job. I drink because I feel trapped in my own mind. I drink because of my living situation. I drink because nothing I do excites me. I drink about 3 times a week and once I crack a bottle of wine, there is no way I can stop. That bottle is getting drunk to the last drop and more often than not, a second one gets opened and lasts about half way until I pass out. \\nThe job thing - realized I’m the only one who can help myself there so I have been taking lots of photos and editing them in an effort to update my portfolio but sitting down and editing those photos sober just isn’t an option. I go to work, I laugh with my coworkers, but at the end of the day, the only thing that makes me happy and that I took forward to is that next drink. I started exercising and have been continuing to do so pretty consistently but I always fall off the boat because I can’t stay excited and motivated. \\nLast night I came home to my collection of wine bottles all out and displayed in front of me by my dad. My mom discovered the first bottle in my closet when she couldn’t find my cat, or so she says. She then proceeded to go through every crevice of my room and pulled out the 20 or so I had hidden. Long story short, my life of drinking after work and during my own photo editing hours is over and I am terrified. I feel like I have nothing happy to come home to. I spent all last night crying and today is the first day I didn’t show up to work because of this. The thing is - I don’t know if I want to stop. I’ve had thoughts of suicide since my early teenage years and they have never gone away. I’ve cut myself on numerous occasions. I have dabbled with the idea of overdosing on my anxiety and depression medication. I did go into therapy for a few months but that turned out way too pricey for my minimal salary. My dad has offered to pay for my therapy last night, but this is an offer I’m not sure I want to take. I just want it to be over. The only times things are okay in my brain is when I am sleeping, or when I am heavily buzzed. I don’t have children, nor a boyfriend and I have maybe 2 friends, so I’m finding it difficult to see a purpose to go on. \\nI would like to finish by saying how awful I feel about putting this out there. The amount of times the word “I” is used is upsetting and selfish since I know there are people out there who have it way worse than me. Like my parents have pointed out numerous times, I have nothing to be sad about. I have a good job, a warm house, food and water. I have a car that my dad so kindly gave to me when he bought himself a new one. And they are right. I have it so good. But inside, that dark cloud just won’t lift and there is no way I can describe it in words to someone who hasn’t felt the pull of it.\\nThank you, from the bottom of my heart to anyone who read this fully, attempted to read it, or even glanced at it.

It’s long, but it would mean the world to me if someone could read it. : I’m just a 20 year old girl, with an amazing family. I have 2 parents who have given me the world, and I am the oldest sibling of 4. I have had a great education all of my life, I went to an awesome university in my town but I had to take a gap year due to my mental health issues. I live on the East Coast, and I have all of the opportunities in the world to live the life I dream of living. I have a therapist, a beautiful house, an absolutely amazing boyfriend, and some close friends. Nowadays though, the life I dream of living consists of these few things: Energy, excitement about my days, and a positive outlook. At this rate, switching my major, finishing college, and moving along in life feels impossible. \\nI took a gap year because the lifelong anxiety I had was starting to take a toll. Originally I had just planned to take a semester off because I wanted to go to therapy and then get back to school. I didn’t want to be out for too long because I thought I wouldn’t want to go back. But that was in September. It’s now March, and after having mono for a few months, not being in school, struggling with anxiety, feeling lonely partially because I am not in school and I’m watching all of my peers live the life I had planned for myself, coupled with mental illness, I have developed depression. At first my psychologist didn’t think I was depressed, because the symptoms of mono coincide with depression. Also, some people have a depressive episode when their anxiety is very bad, which mine was. Luckily it’s a bit better now. But the depression has taken the front row seat now, so that rains on my parade pretty badly. I also talked about the fear of becoming depressed a lot, too. But now fast forward, I most certainly have depression. We are aware of this now. \\nWhat I don’t understand about depression, and never did until I was diagnosed, is the feeling of being hopeless and having nothing to live for, like many depressed people talk about. I used to think, “how could you feel hopeless? There are so many beautiful things in this world. There are so many beautiful places, faces, moments, things to look back on and things to look forward to. You have so many talents and so many amazing qualities, and you make people so happy without even realizing it”. But now, I understand. \\nI truly understood the hopeless feeling when I started realizing the amounts of mental and physical energy it took for me to perform mental tasks... to even *want* to do them, and have a reason for them. My body feels like a rock that I am lugging around. I feel like I don’t even have the capacity to think like I used to, yet somehow I still have all of the energy to overthink. But my creativity is stifled, I don’t see the world as colorfully as I used to, and it feels like even on the nicest of days the world is still the gray winter we’ve had here for so long. I just **don’t have the energy** for almost anything. And sometimes I will get myself going, but I don’t feel as if I am doing my tasks or feeling things the way I used to. I don’t feel full of life and wonder anymore. Small moments don’t bring me a boatload of joy. I used to pride myself in finding happiness and joy in the little things, but now my surroundings feel dull and it’s always like I’m searching for something bigger. Which I know isn’t the issue here. It’s just my brain. I drove to Philly with a friend about 3 weeks ago on a Saturday just for fun, and I thought the new environment would make all the difference, but it just didn’t. I was definitely filled with more enthusiasm than I usually was, but I could only keep that energy for so long. And once again, I didn’t feel how I used to feel before all of this hit. So, back to my original point. I feel hopeless. Because how am I supposed to get anywhere with this lack of motivation and energy? \\nI simply just don’t have the energy or stamina to maintain the activities I need and want to do. I know what’s good for me, what *should* be good for me and making me happy. After all, it used to. But I am always tired in some way. I never feel well rested. I used to be active and energetic but now my body is telling me to lay down, even if it’s bad for my brain. I tell myself I should take care of myself the way a parent would take care of a child. That my body is worth taking care of. But **I am just so sick of FORCING myself to do things. And then not being able to create habits because of the amount of energy it takes. And then feeling totally hopeless.** \\nI do not want to “accept” that I’m depressed. I don’t even like saying I’m depressed, and I hate it even more when people say it isn’t curable. How isn’t it curable? I didn’t have it my whole life. Maybe the signs were there subtly, but if I knew about them, I could’ve done something before I hit this barrier. \\nMy family has done everything for me and I love them so much. I really do. I absolutely love my parents. My mom is so creative, free spirited, stubborn, funny, and on the go. My dad is wise, determined, nurturing, hilarious, and level headed. My siblings all have minds of their own, too. My sister is adventurous and creative like me. My brothers are, well, my brothers. Haha. My grandma is an absolute saint. But a lot of the time, especially recently, it’s hard not to distance myself from my parents when I feel so down. I just feel like the disappointment who is always being watched because of my vulnerable mental state. Everything is always about what I’m not doing, and I know it’s because they care and think me doing things will help, but it’s just not that simple. I get irritable, and this causes tension. I kind of isolate myself from them. Not really, but I just don’t initiate conversation with them. I feel awkward. I’ll fix this but it’s just hard. \\nSomehow — I hate admitting this because I never wanted to get to a place where I felt my significant other was one of the biggest sources of my happiness because it’s unhealthy — my boyfriend makes me feel more alive than most things anymore. It won’t be this way forever, but right now it is. Maybe God, or the universe, or whoever, placed him in my life for a reason. He is the most positive, energetic, happy, stress free, level headed, patient, caring, affectionate, hilarious, awesome person I know. This kid reassured me everyday, just because he **feels** like it, of how much he loves me, how I make him the happiest kid in the world, how I brighten his days, how I make him laugh like nobody else, and any other sweet thing you can think of. And to me, they aren’t cliches because I know he means them. He reassured me that he knows who I am outside of this depression. He loves me for me. And he constantly reminds me that he is here with me every step of the way, that he believes in me, and that he will not leave my side. It blows my mind. I don’t understand it, but man is it relieving. I cannot even explain how much I love him. He just **never** gets frustrated with me, and always prioritizes my happiness. He lives an insanely well balanced life, good for him. He has perfect mental health, and I envy it but I’m more so just grateful to have someone like that in my life. Honestly, he’s been a saving grace some days. \\nI want to get back in school as soon as possible. I want to know how to build myself back up so that I can have a daily routine, and energy, and be excited. I don’t want to feel like my brain and body are stifled anymore. I want myself back. I struggle so much with feelings of “is this worth it?” Because is it? People would surely miss me, but what about *me*? How am I supposed to live if I feel like everything is a matter of me dragging myself out of a ditch? \\nI wish that I could go back in time, and almost just watch my young self from afar. I was so happy go lucky. Spunky. Happy. I wish I could just hold my own hand, and see my smile and take it with me into the future. \\nSometimes I get really scared because I have thoughts about dying. I don’t want to die and I don’t want to commit suicide but what if I become that way to escape the pain? And I go nuts? And I lose my boyfriend and those who matter to me? \\nI wouldn’t wish depression upon anyone. If you read to here then thank you. And if you have any advice, I’m dying to hear it.

Right now it is 3 am here.   \\nWhen I was 11/12 I became very heavily depressed and apathic due to a traumatic childhood, but also further traumas throughout my life made it worse. Therapists didn\\'t notice it and prevention of any further psychological damage was quite late.   \\nI lived a toxic childhood, youth and young adulthood and noticed me being \"different\" when I burned out and everything I bottled up for 18 years just bursted out of me, so I lost my sanity for quite a while and was put down in a mental hospital  \\nAt this point my personality already manifested in a very self destructive way and it was diagnosed as a \"combined personality disorder\". Mental hospitals made my symptoms worse and therapists struggled helping me to an extend where I\\'ve been told \"I can\\'t help you.\".\\nI just recently came out of a very toxic and devastating relationship. Where I finally managed to open up to my partner, who was 4 years older than me. Just to be lied and cheated on, which was, according to her, my fault. I used to get very aggressive in response and use that aggression to become a better version of myself, work out more disciplined, study harder, work better.  \\nBut at this point I\\'m just exhausted. So much that I just stopped caring about anything. Mental pain wasn\\'t easy, but I knew I was alive nonetheless, I always had some shimmer of hope no matter how bad my life was, no matter how many people I\\'ve lost and been betrayed by.  \\nBut now I\\'m here, in the middle of the night not knowing how I feel, I don\\'t know if I feel good, if I feel bad or sad. The voices in my head are gone but at the same time so very empty.  \\nI feel empty, nothing more, nothing less. Pure darkness so deep you feel like you could fall down and never land on ground again.\\nI struggle sleeping, because my mind wants to repeat the past and revisit negative feelings/traumas over and over again. I don\\'t just struggle trusting, I\\'m even paranoid at this point. If a person is nice to me, I immediately expect this person to hurt me at some point.

Very friendly, nice, beautiful and she understands me quite well.  \\nBut I see her as a threat, to me, my soul, my shattered heart. Something that could losen my sanity even more. As if she\\'s the next to add more oil to the fire until it becomes an inferno, another crack into the wall until it breaks and falls apart.   \\nI\\'ve never had anyone in my life who was truely by my side. Only people pretending to be.  \\nBut now she\\'s here, offering me help, and I\\'m here, struggling to take it. This isn\\'t about her, more about something I noticed. I\\'ve never been offered an ear like this, it feels like somebody really means it this time because she\\'s been through similar problems and traumas in life. Usually I\\'d not have to react because I knew it was just a friendly gesture and not really meant to help. More of a noble act to add something more to their superior ego.\\nToday everything I bottled up the past few days, weeks, months and during my most recent relationship rocked down on my chest and the sadness struck upon me. I felt like I\\'d go insane and would need somebody by my side, somebody understanding me from deep down their heart and giving me the feeling of not being alone.   \\nI thought about the offer she made. I said to myself: \"This would be just what I\\'d need right now\", and was about to accept the offer, tell her that I\\'d need her right now, that she should come by. But at this point it felt like my hand could not reach her, as if something is stopping me, blocking me, pulling me away.   \\nThe more I wanted to do it, the more I tried to overcome it, the more it got painful, I felt like bones and muscles were breaking and twisting the closer I got to it. An incredible pain of my negative and darker sides, like dark hands pulling me away and whispering \"This isn\\'t what you want, what we want\".  \\nAnd I didn\\'t. I\\'ve let go of it. Pulled my hand away. And sat down, together with all my negativity just like a meet up, surrounded by my past and all the horrible pain I\\'ve been through before. Staring at my wall in pure emptiness.\\nThinking about it, I noticed asking for it made me feel selfish, egoistic. Things I\\'ve been told in my past repeatedly by people I looked up to, until it got manifested in my mind, that asking for help is something for the weak, that it is egoistic to impose your very own burden on somebody else, to drag and pull down somebody else into your darkness, just because of their bright and shiny light. The reason why I hesitated, struggled and finally gave up on it.\\nSo I\\'m sitting here, wondering \"Is it okay to ask somebody else for help?\".  \\nOfcourse people say it is okay to accept help from a person you love or who is close to you.   \\nBut I also know that people like me, depressed and mentally ill ones, can be hard to handle. We can be complicated and contradictory because of our defense mechanisms. And I\\'m wondering how much of a pain and burden I could be to someone as soon as I accept the offer of help.   \\nAs if the person is about to get into an oath with me, a bond that letting go of has the condition of me getting hurt and disappointed again. Which I think I can not bear another time, because I\\'m exhausted.   \\nAt the same time, all I\\'d need, want and appreciate, is what I always lacked, pure warmth of a person, that I feel is coming out of the heart, that calms me during this chaotic storm called \"Life\".\\nThere\\'s this one particular thought that is bugging me, every single day, the past few years.  \\nSomething I always ask myself when I found myself deep down in my dark hole, isolated and distanced from every human being.

I\\'ve tried a handful of meds, and not only did they not even begin to help, but they all had side-effects ranging from uncomfortable to severe. I started taking CBD oil, and that has actually helped a ton. I\\'m not saying there isn\\'t a med that will work for me, but I haven\\'t found it yet. I\\'ve suffered from depression and anxiety my entire life. I\\'m currently on disability because of my conditions. So there\\'s just a little background for ya.\\n3 months ago, I started a program to become certified in a job in the healthcare field. It\\'s taken me a long time to get to this point. I quit my job, broke up with my girlfriend, and moved back in with my parents about 5 and a half years ago. I decided I needed real help and that I needed to go back to school. I\\'ve been going to school very slowly and gradually built up to being able to handle a real work load. \\nThis past fall I was accepted into a program. The program completion is about 2 years away. On the first day of the program, I met this girl. She was stunning. I\\'m not going to give a ton of identifying detail in this post, but needless to say that I was immediately attracted to her. Of course, I thought about asking her out, but, being the depressed person that I am, I immediately thought that she\\'s out of my league. I also thought about the fact that if it doesn\\'t go well, we will be stuck in the same classes, day in and day out, for the next 2 years. I guess I was afraid that it would be unprofessional or awkward.\\nTwo weeks go by before we see each other again and classes actually start. On the first day of class, she sat next to me and almost immediately teases me. Now I\\'m like, \"great. She\\'s beautiful and witty. This sucks.\" Over the next few days I come to find out that she is *very* intelligent, as well. She\\'s kind; she\\'s fit; she\\'s an athlete; she has a smile that makes me weak. It\\'s honestly hard to look directly at her. This is a bit of a ramble. The point is that I developed a huge crush on her. And it hasn\\'t gone away. I thought perhaps that it\\'d be an infatuation that would fade over time, but instead I find myself thinking about her constantly.\\nI\\'m typically an indecisive, hesitant person, in general. The idea of asking this girl out, though, was just too enormous. *What if she rejects me? What if we go out on one or two dates and then she rejects me? What if we actually date for a decent amount of time but then we break up and we\\'re stuck in this program together? I don\\'t want things to be awkward. I don\\'t want the rumors and the drama and the appearance of unprofessional behavior. I don\\'t want the distraction from this very difficult program. When would I even find the time to attempt such a relationship?* There were just too many variables.\\nAfter a while, though, those questions and concerns seemed to matter less and less. They were still there, but I started to come around to the idea that I needed to do something. I couldn\\'t just have this crush and be in agony. I needed to act. I decided I would invite her out to hang out as friends, and if things went well, I would ask her out. Not a bad idea, right? I would look for signals and see if we have a real connection outside of school.\\nI saw her today at school. She came in and sat by me and another classmate, for no reason. She really just came in to hang out with us.  She\\'s done this several times, and this is part of the reason that I think there might be something there. *But is she coming in to see me or my classmate? Or am I overthinking this? I\\'m probably overthinking this.* \\nWe were working together for a few hours, but she says she has to stop real quick and let her friend in to the building. She mentions it\\'s a \"him.\" I immediately thought, *oh no. She\\'s going to bring in some tall, broad, stud of a smoke-show, and she\\'s going to show me what her type really is.*\\nI\\'m a skinny guy. I\\'m fit. I play sports. I have some decent muscle tone on my chest and abdomen, but I\\'m skinny. I don\\'t have big arms. I\\'m about 5\\'11\" (she\\'s actually about the same height as me. She\\'s quite tall), but I\\'m not super tall. I weigh about 152. I\\'m a skinny guy. It\\'s something that has always bothered me about myself.\\nSo anyway, in walks this tall, broad, stud of a smoke-show. Fuck. My mind immediately went to a dark place. \\nThis guy *is her type. I don\\'t know why I ever thought* I *would be her type. She\\'s tall and beautiful. She doesn\\'t want to be with some scrawny guy that isn\\'t even taller than her. Look at this fuckin guy.

I\\'ve never been so disgusted with myself. I won\\'t go into my exact thinking, but it was some dark stuff, and it was a long drive home.\\nWhen I got home, I immediately crawled into bed. I couldn\\'t do anything. I couldn\\'t get on the internet; I couldn\\'t watch a movie; I couldn\\'t sleep; I couldn\\'t eat; I couldn\\'t read a book; I was in depression purgatory.

I tell myself “you’re never enough” but at this point it’s like a voice in my head that’s not mine but is also my own thoughts at the same time. If I weren’t alive anymore I wouldn’t feel and I wouldn’t have to suffer any longer. No more late nights crying in bed. No more cutting my forearms. No more waiting for the blood to clot so I don’t get blood all over my bed. No more of that sting that I feel when I take a shower and reminds me of the pain I go though on a daily basis. I would just be gone. I would finally be free and possibly even happy.', 'text_b': None, 'label': 1}, {'guid': 1564, 'text_a': \"Why do I think I'm so great? : I believe that I am capable of anything, so I am disappointed when I fail to achieve.\\nI don't know where this post is going, but I'm not going to stop it.

I have recently quit a very good paying job that I didn’t hate. Gave/ thrown away most of my things. Then moved into an 8x12 garden shed out in the woods.

I grew up on a farm 5 miles from a small town. With my dad and older brother. My dad has some trust and paranoia issues. So other people were not welcome at our home. Our whole world was the three of us and the farm. When I was 13-14 my brother ran away. A few months later my dad moved out. After the state found out they placed me with my mom. She lived in an apartment in a city with my two half brothers. I acted out and spent the rest of my teenage years in and out of juvenile placements. As a young adult I used/sold/made drugs. In and out of jail finally spending my early and mid twenties in prison.

I’m gonna try to label the sections in all caps so if anyone wants to skip around they can. Also I’m on mobile so I’m sorry for the formatting )-: \\nINTRO: I (22f) attend a university in the US and am in a major where there’s only like 20 students in my “grade” (like freshman, sophomore, etc.) and we are all in the same classes together and have been for four years, so it’s hard to meet other people. We have all also had the same group of professors for four years. So we all are very familiar with each other. \\nI’m a senior and it is my last semester, I graduate this May. The head of the department is very involved and is making sure that each of us individually are on the track to graduating. \\nBACKGROUND: As a little background I have had severe anxiety and depression for as long as I can remember. I also have mild PTSD. I’m in a situation where my mom raised me by herself and was a great mom but also was incredibly verbally and emotionally abusive so I basically am terrified of confrontation, am a huge people pleaser, definitely do not do anything to stand out, and I follow directions and I do what I’m supposed to do (which is get decent grades, live independently and take care of my two pets, it just worked out that I work at a wonderful job that wants to take me on after I graduate, basically I’m just trying to be successful so my mom is proud of me). I have been seeing a therapist and psychiatrist actively and seeking treatment, but I have relapsed a handful of times. \\nThroughout my college career, it never fails that at some point in the semester there is a week or two where I fall into a depression pit and get too anxious to leave home but I still complete my projects (my major is VERY project based) and have never missed a deadline. I have never failed a class before. During these times I have been quite open with specific professors because there is an attendance policy in place where you can have 3 unexcused absences and after that your grade is affected. I have spoken so far to 3 professors and they have all been super wonderful and empathetic and willing to work with me. \\nFor my senior project, I am as far along as everyone else and continue to produce work even though my mental health has been suffering recently. My studio professor got hired about a year ago give or take and we have never had him before as a professor so none of the seniors know him well. The senior studios are split up into two classrooms, so there are two professors but we are all working on our final projects. My professor is incredibly rude and snarky and has an attitude with everybody. He has called students incompetent and told one particular girl that she didn’t have the ability to become our profession. He yelled at another student in front of everyone before. His work load is insane and way more work than the other senior studio. Today they just turned in a deadline that we turned in two weeks ago. Not only does he want us to work on our senior project but he wants to throw all kinds of extra assignments in there when that’s not the point of the class. It’s to do our final thesis project. \\nSITUATION: Recently I had missed a few weeks of school because I was going through intense shit with my mom, I was physically ill with the flu and then I got a sinus infection on top of that, but was keeping him updated. I got a note from an urgent care type place stating that I was ill with a flu like virus and I sent a picture of it to him in an email. I did not attend class the next day either because duh I have all the flu symptoms. I don’t think he counted that as excused because I didn’t get a note for that day, but I’m not going to pay $80 every day that I’m sick after they already prescribed me medicine and whatever just so I can get a note ???? \\nSo the following week goes by and I’m not getting any better and am getting more symptoms of a sinus infection. Great. Obviously I didn’t go to class. This is where I messed up because I should have gone to the doctor sooner to get an excuse I guess. \\nI was emailing him and telling him that I wasn’t going to class and as we were just working on our projects for the upcoming deadline this literal entire time, I didn’t need to physically be there because I have the software I need for it on my laptop. So I am continuing to work on my project this whooole time. The deadline was that Friday and we were presenting in front of the class and a guest. I was still ill but sucked it up bc it was a presentation. I went to school early to print my project and my sweet boyfriend drove me because he knew I was having a hard time. So I didn’t bring my wallet. Big accident. I went to print my presentation at our printing lab(11 x 17 sheets) and after a freaking insane amount of time wasted because the front desk people weren’t there, I realized that they only take the school cash and my school ID was in my wallet at home. At this point class had already started and I was PANICKING. I could feel my face getting hot and my body shaking. I went outside to get some cool air but it did not help. I was having a panic attack and crying and hyperventilating. I called my boyfriend and said screw this come pick me up because I’m not going in empty handed to explain why I have no presentation while I’m full on sobbing in front of my peers and a guest. \\nI did send him an email before I left and explained what happened. I was SO embarrassed. I profusely apologized, accepted a grade penalty, and explained my mental health issues because this had to do with that and I’ve been able to be open with professors of the same college before with no problem. He didn’t email me back ever, which I was like what the fuck because that was a serious email. \\nSo the next Monday I’m still feeling like shit so I go to the on campus doctor. I have a sinus infection, my ears are clogged so i can’t hear, snot is constantly falling from my nose, I’m constantly coughing. It’s gross. While I’m there I figure I will get a note to excuse last week. The doctor wrote that I was ill last week and the day that I came in, signed and dated it. I sent my professor this email to explain why I was so sick and again he didn’t answer me. \\nFast forward to a few days later and my antibiotics aren’t working. The doctor had prescribed me amoxicillin but I do better with augmentin. I should have mentioned that to him but it didn’t occur to me. I emailed him this note bc it was on the day of class and said my antibiotics are not working this is why I’m not in class. He did not respond for a third time and stated that I would be attending class that Friday. At this point I’m freaking out. He’s purposely ignoring me and I was still incredibly embarrassed and shameful about my panic attack at school so this was just making it worse. \\nThat Friday I did not go. I know I told him I would. But I can honestly say that I didn’t go because of how fucking anxious I was to see his reaction to me. \\nI was a wreck the whole weekend. I cried so hard, had several panic attacks and it was overall not a fun time. My poor boyfriend was doing his best to try to comfort me. He is the only person I talk to other than my therapist. I don’t have any other friends because nobody in my major likes me because of the fact that I miss class a lot and am generally really quiet. My mom has told me its my fault they don’t like me. \\nHe actually ended up cancelling class on that Monday which was a relief for me! So I went on Wednesday. I talked to my therapist that morning and we had planned that I would go in at the start of class and bring him my notes and tell him I wanted to show him my project. I went to go pull out my laptop and pulled up my project to discuss it with him. He came up to me and asked me if these notes were the ones I emailed him. I said yes, I brought them because you never responded to me and I wanted to make sure you got them. He said with an attitude “well you have a lot of unexcused absences”. I started to say something but I only got out “I can-“ at which point he cut me off and said (while there were other students around bc we were at my desk) “I don’t know what you’re going to do but you’re not going to pass”, and this part is fuzzy because I was already blindsided at this point, but he said something to the effect of “and fix whatever else is going on” which I took personally as a jab at my mental health. and then walked away from me and proceeded to call another student up to him to discuss their project. \\nI sat there in disbelief. What the fuck. Right? What the fuck? If I don’t pass this class I will not graduate. If I don’t graduate I lose my job. My family will be SO disappointed, especially my mother who is taking on debt for me to attend college. I sat there for a few minutes and tried to work. I could feel myself getting worked up and I could feel the panic coming. My eyes started watering and I had to get the fuck out of there.  I went outside and didn’t know what to do. I couldn’t call my boyfriend because I knew he was in an exam at the time. I tried calling my therapist but she didn’t answer which I totally understand because she’s super busy but I thought I would try anyways. \\nI took a walk around campus to try to calm down but I eventually ended up behind some dumpsters sobbing and hyperventilating. I called my dad who I have a great relationship with now (not so much when I was younger) and he was really supportive, he talked to me until my boyfriend got out of his exam and could drive me home. \\nI’m at a loss. I attended work the next day and broke down there. They sent me home. I spent the whole day hating myself and sobbing. I have one friend in my major who I consider a very close friend if not my best friend even if I’m not hers. We have been friends for 3 years and she knows almost every detail of my life. I told her about this and she said I needed to meet with the head of our major. She helped me organize my thoughts and write out an email and I sent it last night. \\nNow it’s today and I woke up crying, I genuinely had for the first time suicidal thoughts. My head was pounding and I couldn’t stop obsessing over this. My therapist called me and talked with me for 10 minutes which I appreciate more than she will ever know. She literally talked me off the ledge, she called me while I was sobbing. \\nFast forward and I grew some balls and went to studio. I went straight to my desk and my friend who sits across from me completely ignored me. She didn’t look at me or anything even when I spoke to her directly (which was really only a little conversation but she avoided eye contact) So I just worked on my stuff the whole studio, which is 4 hours long. I wanted to just work on my project but something unexpected happened and my professor assigned an assignment that was due at the end of class, something that he never does. I think he did this bc he thought I wouldn’t be there today. He avoided looking at me the entire class and when he went around to everyone’s desks he went to mine last. Our assignment was to hand draw 5 separate detailed items of our project. He told us a specific example to use, which coincidentally I was already thinking of doing, so I drew it. He came over to me and told me he didn’t get why I put it there and what it has to do with anything. Then he went to the girl next to me and she was like “I don’t know what to draw” and he told her she could draw what I just fucking drew. At the end of class he went around again and spoke to everyone again once except me. \\nAnd now here I am. I really don’t know what to do. I hate myself because I know this situation is my fault and I should have just gone to class. If you made it this far I really really appreciate it.

I spent my teens mostly in my room playing games, watching movies and not much else. I was very isolated. I can\\'t decide how much blame to level against myself for this. How much should a 15 year old be blamed for not enrolling himself in high school, especially when it doesn\\'t seem to matter to anyone around him?\\nSimilarly they never pushed me to get a job and so i just... never did.I did go to film school (which is a whole, long, sad, depressing story in and of it\\'s self) but nothing came of it. I also spent a few months looking for work but didn\\'t get so much as an email back from anyone. I guess it\\'s not hard to see why when you, an employer, are looking at a 28 year old with no work experience...\\nAbout the only good thing that came out of this was meeting my long time boyfriend which leads me to the second major thing. I met him on line when i was 17 and we\\'ve been together for about a decade now. long distance relationships are hard, but it\\'s even harder to sustain one for so long. I love him more than anything and love being around him. Every year one of us goes to visit the other for a few months and they have been some of the happiest times in my life. that being said there have been some extremely hard times, not the least of which was when he cheated on me.\\nhe\\'s always bee very sexual so I suppose I should have known what I was getting myself into. We had a semi open relationship. it wasn\\'t my idea and after years of arguing we came to a compromise. blowjobs only. it upset me but seemed almost necessary. we only see each other once a year, we where both young and horny (one of us hornier than the other) and it seemed like a fair compromise to let him explore with other people since he couldn\\'t do it with me.\\nHe started becoming infatuated with one of his friends. he told me over and over again that it was nothing serious. i really believe he thought that because one day he came to me, told me that I was right and said he was backing off and told his friend to do this same. about a year later he cheated on me with him multiple times. he broke our rule which he knew i was already not a fan of.\\nwhat you need to understand is, the last two paragraphs take place over years. when ever he would go out with his friends i was always left alone to wonder what he\\'s doing with them. it was constant torture and that\\'s before he cheated on me, and he knew that. it didn\\'t help anything that he was surrounded by people to play around with but I wasn\\'t. I only had him. I\\'m 28 and have only ever been with four people including him. the other three where out of desperation. A way to back at/keep up with him and the only way to, at least in some part, blow off some of that frustration and anger. because of that, it was always awkward and I only saw one of them more than once. I really started to grow to hate sex.\\nwhen he cheated on me it destroyed me. it was the lowest moment in my life. No one to talk to, no real friends, no guidance, nothing. We spent months trying to patch things up. I still loved him and cared about him and didn\\'t want to be without him so... i decided to open the relationship entirely. My only rule was to use a condom (Which he hadn\\'t been). I feel like a door mat... he cheated on me and i rewarded him by not only letting him keep hanging out with the guy (who he says is his best friend) but also let him keep sleeping with him. whenever i was out of contact with him because he was out with his friends my depression and jealousy was crippling. I tore my room apart, was always angry, and was just generally out of control of my own brain.\\nI even tried to see a shrink during this time who ignored the things i wanted to talk about, didn\\'t seem to care at all about this mess, kept fucking up my billing and forgetting to schedule appointments.\\nThe time of year came when we would see each other and it was decided i would go to him this time. he thought if I met the guy that i wouldn\\'t feel so bad. I spent three months there. it was incredibly awkward with his friends and especially that guy. the trip was very stressful. His so called \"best friend\" was a huge dick and constantly made a problem of himself to the point of even my boyfriend losing it on multiple occasions. After the whole mess my boyfriend said he really doesn\\'t blame me for hating him.\\ndespite that, our relationship got back on track. we where doing really well. this was going to be the first year we spent Christmas together. I went there in the summer, then a few months later he came here for Christmas. in between, he put the open part of our relationship on hold which made me really happy.\\nbut now Christmas is over and he\\'s gone back home and we\\'re not sure when we\\'ll see each other again. we\\'re trying to get married but international marriage is difficult and we\\'re currently at a loss. it\\'s always hard when we separate after months together but this time has been much harder. we don\\'t know when we\\'ll see each other again, both of us are very stressed out trying to bring our lives together while also trying to support ourselves individually and, for me, on top of it is the memory of the place i was in last year and i feel myself sliding back to the anger and jealousy. I know it\\'s only a matter of time before he starts fooling around again and i know he\\'s already trying to open the possibility with more of his friends.\\nI don\\'t know how to handle this anymore. i\\'m tired of only having myself to talk to. i\\'m tired of feeling walked on. i\\'m tired of feeling like, even if i wanted to, i don\\'t have the life or personality that would let me participate in this openness.\\nI really do love him and i know he really loves me. When we\\'re together we\\'re inseparable and do EVERYTHING together. but when we\\'re apart it\\'s like i become less important to his life... maybe it\\'s just his defense mechanism for dealing with the distance but when we separate all i want to do is cling to him, he seems to pull away and it\\'s a lot of work to keep things together.\\nSo, my situation is, i\\'m 28, living with my parents, never had a job, have no life skills and very little social skills. I\\'m in a long distance relationship with someone i love more than anything but he cheated on me and is now back home with his friends who, any one of them could be the next person. I have no friends and my parents (who neglected me) are really my only family. i\\'m depressed, angry, scared and above all, I can\\'t even motivate myself to do the things i know i need to do. feel completely useless and broken.\\nI was laying in bed last night with all of this running through my head (remembering of course that even all this is only a small part of the story. their\\'s definitely more.) and the thought just occurred to me, \"what if i just fucking killed myself.\".

This diagnosis caused me to be separated from the military. At the time I was ok with it. I felt that it was just a sign to move on to another stage of my life. From there I decided to go back to school. I wanted to finish my degree and get a job using that degree. This would have went well but unforeseen circumstances have caused some major issues with that plan. The school isn’t offering the classes that I need to finish the degree for at least a term for one and two for the other courses. With school being payed by the VA and them also providing a housing allowance this was my source of income, but I can’t get that in on if I’m not going to school. I was fully prepared to cut down on spending while I waited to find a job to tide me over. I am married and my wife has a steady job so at least we have some income, but I have been the only one to cut down on the spending. While trying to get my wife to cut down a little bit on spending, she decided to get an additional job to earn a little extra money. Initially I was very happy with that. The thing is she has been always working and I am struggling to get a job. The bills were fine initially but eventually credit card began having higher and higher balances and the savings began dwindling. My wife has been using her second job not to assist in paying the bills but to sequester away to use as fun money. Again no issue initially. Over time it was notice that more an more time and money was spent towards time with her friends while I ended up stuck at home based on the fact that money was leaving faster than it was coming in. I have asked to be included, but she tells me she doesn’t want my negativity around her friends. This hurt me and made me take a close look at the situation. The past year or so communication has really been almost nonexistent between us about the happenings of our lives. This was ok when I was In The military because I spent a large portion of my time at work. I really wanted to push towards better communication and time together when we could get it without cutting out her friends.  I began working my communication while I was busy with school. I made sure to tell her when I had free time so that we could spend time together. Multiple times that I let her know that I was going to be free on a specific day or that I would make time to spend with her when I knew she was free, she would instead make plans with her friends. Time after time of this happening has just beat me down emotionally. It’s even more noticeable now that I am home all the time job hunting and I still get to see my wife less then her friends see her. The combination of the situations that put me in an idle state and it seeming like she doesn’t want to be around me has put me in a very dark place. I have been seeing a counselor with her over the past couple of months in hopes of rebuilding the communication bridge and trying to get her to see how I feel and me to see how she feels about everything. The thing is that whenever a conversation about such things happens between us she glazes over and it seems like no attention is being payed. This again bashed my self worth. The counselor eventually referred me to a medical professional who diagnosed me with major depression and prescribed me medication. The medication helps for the most part, but I keep getting lack of value impressions from my wife that just puts me right back in my hole. Over the past few months I have thought about suicide many many times. I have never thought about doing it, just about how I could do it. This scares the crap out of me. It takes a lot of thinking about my parents and my sister to get those negative thoughts out of my head. I am at a loss though I love my wife so much, and I think my wife loves me in her own way. The thing is us not being on the same page is destroying me, and in turn our relationship. I know it’s not all my fault and that it’s not all hers, it is a combination of everything. I feel like I have been bending over backwards to promote healing in my life and my relationship with my wife. I don’t feel that I am getting the effort back from my wife. I am at a loss of what to do. I can’t seem to dig myself out of this hole and I can’t seem to get the help from my wife because neither of us know how. My wife not knowing how to help seems to have turned into not wanting to deal with it. \\nMy life is not where I want it to be right now, and I feel like I am lacking the support to get there by the one I love most.', 'text_b': None, 'label': 1}, {'guid': 1917, 'text_a': 'I don\\'t know why I don\\'t do what I want, I don\\'t know who I am : Hello, I will try to simplify this post but it could be long\\nI am a 19 years old, and currently in college. I don\\'t have much friends so I find it difficult to confide to anyone, and my parents used to be very strict and I usually perform well academically so I prefer not to let them down. So here I am here. I want to change myself for the better and I want to learn to care for myself (what I want long-term not short-term).\\nWhen people ask me what I enjoy doing, I say maths. I tried very hard in learning maths since 2 and a half years ago, and the context is that I was preparing for a \"high-level\" math exam. Thinking back to the time, I don\\'t know if I tried so hard because I found maths fun, or because I just wanted to prove that I can achieve something impressive. Another thing is since 11th grade I started to lose friends and I truthfully don\\'t know why I lose friends, but it could be because I am too scared at making conversations. So in 11th and 12th grade I tried instead very hard in learning even more math, doing both the IB higher level and Further level Maths. Of course, during that time I spent my free time not revising and doing math in doing my own stuff such as watching animate, playing games, etc.\\nHowever, I always try to take the hardest course in maths, so truthfully a part of me realizes that I do maths not because I like math, but I have some sort of ego and I want to prove to people around me that I am better than them.\\nNow, I reach the point where I took way too much challenging classes in university, and it is almost finals and I find myself playing Minecraft and failing to control myself. Sometimes people ask me if I want to do something or have something to do, and I say \"I am busy\". Then, I say to myself \"I should probably use that time revising\" but end up playing minecraft (or another game but I believe they are still the same idea). I thought I liked maths, so I am supposed to find it as fun doing maths as playing minecraft, but my subconsciousness just push me to play minecraft rather than do maths, and I play several hours without stop, even if I initially allocate a small amount of time on it. \\nSo, here is 2 questions I want to solve, and I want to ask if anyone can guide me to solving it:  \\n1. Why don\\'t I understand myself? How do I know if I really enjoy maths as itself? I am so confused even after 2 years of learning a load of maths.\\n2. What do I want in life? of course I want to feel happiness, but truthfully the only thing I know I want is recognition and for others to love me, and this I am sure I want. I just know this because my whole heart feels happy when I get recognition. Other than that, I really am not sure what I want long-term. Many times I imagine myself mastering all the math concepts and become some math genius, and people recognize me for my hard work and achievements. Another thing I want to say is I am sure I want to love doing math, but what if I don\\'t love math in reality?

(Not being happy can have many causes therefore I can not guarantee that the method that I am going to explain will help for everyone.)\\nFirst of all I want to say that I do not recommend you to suppress your emotions. Feeling emotions can be helpful in many ways. It can for example tell you that you do not like certain things or that certain things need to be changed. But as a child probably almost everyone told you ¨I want you to be happy¨. Therefore you started to feel bad if you did not feel happy. So you feel even more bad than you did before. But like I just said, your emotions can be helpful in many ways. So you do not have to feel bad about it if you are not happy.\\nIn today's society most people are raised in a way that they start thinking constantly. And if you observe these thinking patterns you start to see that most people are just repeating their thoughts over and over again. And at a point they even start thinking about their own created thoughts that they are repeating over and over again. Therefore they have nothing to think about except thoughts. And then there comes a point that they are just living in their head. And because of that they are not seeing the beauty of life anymore. People can go to work everyday and if you ask them for example ¨Did you see the appletree at the side of the road when you was on your way to work?¨ They will probably say ´´No I didn't see it´´. So they are just caught up in their thoughts not experiencing life anymore. So try to still your mind, by for example meditation (If you want mediation techniques, feel free to ask, you can even send me a dm @quintenvanommen.) Once your are not caught up in your thoughts anymore you can start experiencing life again. On your way to work you can see the appletree, you can see the apples, you can see the apples falling. And if you eat you are just eating. Your are experiencing the apple or whatever you are eating. And than if you drink afterwards a cup of tea for example. Just drink the cup of tea and taste the tea. Once you are doing this you will experience life again, and you will probably become more happy.\\nHave a nice day\\nYours sincerely, Quinten van Ommen\", 'text_b': None, 'label': 1}, {'guid': 2001, 'text_a': 'I think today is the day.... :) : I am going to visit my ex and I’s love lock that didn’t mean jack fucking shit in the end and then jump in front of a train because the tracks are near the location of the lock. \\nToday is an anniversary for us getting together but he fucking ended up cheating on me while I am pregnant in an unplanned pregnancy. \\nI don’t see a way out of this.

I didn´t like to be around people because i used to feel them as idiots or douchebags. (Most of my classmates, used a lot of homophobic terms, racists stuff, and they all were very religious) So.\\nI found a group of people who were nice. And where kinda like me. The group had 4 girls and 3 boys. (One of the boys and 2 of the girls were from others classes) so. After a time, i started to have feelings for one of the girls. After a time i decided to confess to her my feelings. And well... she rejected me. And i was ok with it. Everyone can do whatever they want (If they´re not hurting anyone) she told me that, i don´t have anything wrong but that she doesn´t want to have anything serious. And we were both okay with that. A week later... she started to date a guy who didn´t use soap... (And, yeah. He kinda smelled like shit) At the end of 2019. Our group was kinda broken. We were only 2 females and 2 males. (She, a friend of her, my best friend and I) Well. In 2019 i started to.... feel things for her again, and i was worried. Bc i didn´t want to leave the group because of my stupid feelings. So i tell my best friend about that. After some time... HE started dating her. .-.\\nSo yeah. My best friend and my crush... at my backs... yeah... they both knowning everything. For weeks i felt like trash and cried a lot. They kinda \"apologized\" (But, they wasn´t like.... really trying to feel sorry. They were just being polite) and after a time they broke up. Their relationship was not going well.\\nWeeeeelll.... she was feeling pretty bad, all the time and i told her that EVEN if she had been a piece of shit with me, i will be there for her. And she kinda took it well, and started to talk to me every day.\\nAfter a week or so, she told me that she was planning on harming him or herself. So i kinda freaked out. (I wasn´t in my country at the time) So. After i call her like 20 times. bc her last message was a \"Sorry\" and disconnect. I heard that she kinda hurt herself. I blame him for that, and when i was in home again and we all meet in school. (Well, when i meet them again in school. They already were talking and stuff) Like.\\nThey were GOOD FRIENDS AGAIN.

Hello! Some profanity and some references to sex ahead (plus depression and suicide and suicidal ideation), so I'm tagging this NSFW I guess?\\nSo, I'm having a bit of a think here about my current situation and honestly, this issue is not a bad problem to have. As in, I feel bad that this is something I’m complaining about, here of all places, but I’m feeling kinda lost. A lot lost. I don't know if I need some advice or just to put this in writing so I can look at it in the form of words rather than manic anxiety and internal screaming. I suspect this is going to be really f\\\\*\\\\*\\\\*\\\\*\\\\*g long, so very sorry about that. Hope some of you stick with me to the end.\\nOk so context: I have a few mental health issues, most notably big time depression which has an organic cause. That means it doesn’t necessarily originate from any life event, and instead is an inescapable, life-long and not-very-treatable condition that results from my brain being wired like shit. Over the past 15 years or so (I’m 29) I’ve been steadily isolating myself and I never really learned how to form like personal connections beyond the shallowest kind (and those were mostly by proxy. Friends of friends, stuff like that). I did try to kill myself at one point, a few years ago, when I was at a specially low point. And it turns out I’m really bad at suicide, which is probably the only reason I haven’t tried again yet because if you try and fail to kill yourself there’s a lot of drama and it’s exhausting. And honestly I don't have the energy to try and make a life I'm content with, it just sounds too... too much.\\nAnd since then, well… I’d mostly accepted that being alive wasn’t something that I liked very much. I derive(d) very little pleasure from anything, endlessly tortured myself psychologically because when I felt bad at least I felt something, and didn’t have much of an interest in completing my education, finding a job, moving out of my parents’ home… Y’know, just generally having a life. I had sort of accepted, in a truly chill way, that I was merely existing between depressive episodes and that the next one very well could be the one to push me over the edge, so why bother? I was going to die, and honestly it was going to be soon, and there were means and there was planning. Most of the time, going through life without an escape plan (by which I mean suicide) was simply impossible. Like, I probably wouldn’t have lived to see August. I was considering my birthday, which on the one hand has the very nifty way of reducing peak grief days for my family and stuff, but on the other hand commiting suicide on your 30th birthday is just like ugh.\\nAND THEN, like a month ago, it just fucking went away. Like, I’m not FINE fine, but for the first time since I can remember I’m in a genuine, sort of stable good mood. I have energy, I am making some (SOME) good choices, I want to surround myself with people. For the first time in my life I’m thinking that maybe it would be nice to have a job, one that pays just well enough to move out and live with roomates or something. Learn how to deal with people, because currently I just don’t know how to people, and perhaps one day have a romantic relationship. Or several!\\nI’m not going to lie, I didn’t exactly welcome this change. I don’t know where it came from (I’ll get there sorry this is so long), or what to do with all that energy, or what I’m feeling most of the time because I have no context for any of this emotions. And a little later I just started to be terrified, all of the time, that one day it’s going to go away and never come back. I’m still terrified and confused and all that, but somehow it doesn’t detract from my good mood because now I’m a positive person I guess. Disgusting.\\nOKAY, that was context, so sorry for the rant. Here comes another one.\\nSo around the time this started, I was starting to hang out a bit more often with some friends of friends, always as a group. I like them very much, and I knew one of them beforehand. He’s really nice and the kind of person I would really like to hang out one-on-one (which we have, once, I think) if I knew how to like bond with people and talk to them just because, and if one-on-one weren’t such a terrifying thing. Kind of a mess, he is, but like in a sometimes endearing way. A bit sitcomy I guess. And while I honestly don’t know (because I don’t know anything anymore), I’m starting to fear that I might have a bit of a crush on him, which would be all-around terrible for several reasons.\\nFirst, feelings? Gross. I’ve rarely liked a guy. Hell, I haven’t ever kissed a boy I had feelings for. I’ve kissed many, fucked even more (rarely good, rarely worth it, always punishing), but never one I actually wanted to kiss. I don’t know if I know how to do that.\\nSecond, I’m happy but I’m not an idiot. If this is actually a crush, nothing good is ever going to come out of it. No way no how.\\nThird, timing. I was going to die, by my hand, soon, and now I have a new lease on life. Can you imagine that my sudden change is because I like a boy? It would be so sad, and really dangerous, and again so very sad. And I’m fine now, but what if I start wallowing about it? I can’t afford that.\\nSo I’ve come to the conclusion that me having a crush on this dude is:\\n* Really gross.\\n* Potentially lethal (for me).\\n* Ugh.\\nAnd like I said, I truly don’t think I’m in denial. I honestly don’t know and I’ve come (as I write this) to the very reasonable conclusion that the answer better be “no”. And I can’t tell, I really can’t tell. Yes, I feel sort of funky when I hear about his relationships and crushes and romantic connections, but honestly that doesn’t tell me much because I’ve always felt bad when hearing about blossoming new romances and shit, because it brings out many of my own insecurities.\\nI guess this is it? Oh, man.\\nTL;DR: I have depression, anxiety and a few other stuff going on, I don’t really have the energy or motivation to try to do anything about that, was planning to kill myself soon and then one day out of the blue I felt a lot better. Didn’t like it, didn’t understand it, live in fear it’s going to go away and never come back, now I don’t understand my own emotions most of the time. Because of timing I’m afraid I might possibly have a crush and that’s why I feel better, because that would suck real bad.\", 'text_b': None, 'label': 1}, {'guid': 2042, 'text_a': 'Overthinking... : I’m 18(m) but I’m always told I’m mature for my age.

There were 3 guys and 3 girls including me and so as teenagers normally would, we sort of paired up and each sat next to one of the girls.

Im not sure if it was here that my mom had a shop in another country with my aunt. i drove like every weekend and holiday for 2 years  there, on the way i first time learned to controll what i see, in your words imanigation, from that point on i done it like extremly often. around that time when i was out i had my first friend outside of the school, we were often in the forest doing shit, with my belgium cousin we played minecraft on a virus flooded laptop from me and yea life was simple for me.  \\nITS TIME TO LET THE SHIT GO DOWN\\nonce a battle over money came up and we litterally fleed with an other cousin wich lived at my aunt out of the country, we did hide our car somewhere and he broke multible windows and raced in a 50 zone with 130 and lost after that they his license for a while, we escaped to our home country. then my mom opened her own buisness. meanwhile i came in the 5th grade and had fun batteling with 11th graders in sience and i also learned that my brain is slowly advancing stupidly fast, a teacher gave me a long mathematic x=... and he just gave me one precalculated one, i remember that i didnt know what ( etc means but after 30min watching it i learned to calculate such equaltion , also in my head i could controll my dreams, i builded up a futurist world where everything is fine and the technologys i created over time in my head are real machines wich are innovative.) i didnt make really friends at that time, it didnt bother me. in 6/7th grade i had a social teacher helping me since i saw her as a mother at that time my head started to let me see memories like a video, my brain adapted to an pc analysing like vision, my math grades exploded, also i kept rooms i was in in my head and on the floor when light was off i could overdraw what i see with red lines and also i could manipulate my own memories (wich fucked me since im not sure if anything i tell here isnt a fucking manipulation) in that time i was often in illegal streams too to watch anime, once i got interested and just pressed on a ad with flat boobs, i keep doing that until i came to a page with pornhub at start and a link going my entire screen, it was my first contact with cp. To this day im sure that some people from pornhub host in normal net childporn but just hide it extremly well. Also WTF can a little kid find cp but not some fucking paid police officers.... Then it interested me, i didnt get hard or something, it was just sheer the new wich dragged me to get tor and seach stuff up and i did find it and i watched it a whole year, i wanted to know why people do such things and so on, it just interested me their motives, i know its terrible and im preparing already for the negative karma flood but yea, (watched reddit videos). then i skipped a class again. in my new class my grades exploded in the prositiv and i met a girl, the girl teached me emotions over time, in winter also i had a relation started with a girl wich i played often and we videochatted alot, she was a year younger then me, you need to know that i was fat at that time and some people really though im old, even tho i wasnt even 15... her brother forced us to stop contact. after that i was down and really sad. at that spring my head started to hurt a bit always and slowly i my ability to remember stuff got bad, when i overjumped i knew wich cloth everyone had to any day, i could give exact dialogs some days after so on. at that time i stopped the relation with my best and first real friend i had since he emotionally abused me. my parents splitted also up a year before and my mom moved to another man and left me and my brother together at a home, i was the one who said yes but yea, i also saw all the abuse from my parents aganist each other... even the blood on the floor. but back in the time now i also slept like 2-4 hrs everyday... i also stopped really learning new things ( men while i type this down i stopped and started alot of shit lol) she also teached me how to talk normal and not just in complicated words, funny thing is i can now just talk so and not complicated. i also took an iq test wich revealed that im very close to autism, my brain structure is different and the test were made in 4 catergory's, in one i had 78 point and in the highest i had 138, the docs told me they never seen such an difference, the highest they even knew before was 24. wich is extrem already, over years my grades got worse, my meorie system is fucked now, i can remembler like almost nothing, i cant learn anymore, i had 2 breakdowns, i figured out that my family dont cares about me, my brother emotionally abuses me, i cant learn anymore and i feel degenerating. i lost my vision my dream world wich always protected me, i have now friends and emphaty but the question is what do i do now?  \\nIm stuck, i want out of this life, i wanna develope the technologys in my head but how when noone belives me, i could have a trauma from the forced end relation from the other shit or from the time where an another aunt used a hammer to attack us with the aunt before to get somehow money, i stopped to belive in god a long time ago, im just lost, i want my memories back my old abilitys, i wanna find a way how to get out of this shit, i know i missed alot of informations but does anyone know what i have to do, i tried to give an text about whats wrong with me but im just not fine anymore. please help me, im lost my memories are gone im degenerating my mental health getting abused my family doesnt care about me. What should i do...  \\ni know its terrible written, but i just lost the ability to write it better, but its getting every day worse, im at a point where i read text a then b then c and after c i know just c...

I\\'m a private person so I don\\'t ask too much about others and expect the same in return. So basically this dude DMs me and says he likes my music, I thank him for the support and send him an unreleased track (which isn\\'t abnormal for me, I send my music to anyone who will listen). So one day I do a QnA and he asks me, \"How does p!ssy taste?\" This shakes me up kinda because even though I don\\'t hide my sexuality, I keep it to myself and don\\'t go into detail. I tell him to never ask me something like that again and says he understands, I brush it off as a one time occurrence. I decide to start to dry text more than I usually do, avoid, and distance. One day he DMs me again, and is like, \"check my story.\" I tell him that there\\'s no way I\\'m doing that without knowing whats on the story. He tells me he plans on dropping his ex girlfriend\\'s nudes but tells me whats on his story is just a fight, I shut him down immediately and tell him what he wants to do is illegal. I don\\'t click the story and I move on. The last occurrence was after he sent me a meme. I sent him a 100 emoji hoping to end the conversation naturally then out of no where he\\'s like, \"This girl tried to send me titty pics but got mad when I said I didn\\'t care\" Again, I shut him down and was like, \"I don\\'t want to talk about this and I\\'m not the person to speak to on this.\" He says he understands and is like, \"I respect that, I\\'m just really young so I don\\'t understand things like that.\" that freaks me out, like this dude knew I don\\'t discuss sexual things. I just tell him, \"everyone has boundaries\". He described me as \"family-friendly\" to my face. I don\\'t know anything about this person, he did mention something about being three in 2010 when Nicki Minaj was famous but I have no way of verifying that.\\nSo that brings me to recent events, I end up telling him to stop contacting me (I made a public post about leaving me alone that was partially at him and to set firm boundaries) . Out of morbid curiosity I go onto his twitter. I see an Omegle chat where he claims to be 18 but who really knows, I scroll down and I see that he\\'s tweeted out pornhub videos (which is something I don\\'t see very often). I go onto his likes and at first it\\'s just some sports stuff. I decide to scroll down some more and it goes from \"porn out of context\" clips to hentai, some weird hentai too like girl being roughly screwed by humanoid pig creature porn. That\\'s when it clicks why he didn\\'t respect my boundaries, it puts everything else into context as well. So that brings me to where I am right now. I feel conflicted. I feel like this is my fault because I didn\\'t research who this person fully was, granted I shut down certain topics if I felt like they were going in a direction I didn\\'t like. I handled it the best I could. I blocked him shortly after. I feel stupid and weak because I didn\\'t stand up for myself but I just assumed it was going to end up being a one time event and the first time was a simple misunderstanding.

My last relationship was way over before I even knew it. I was with this girl for quite some time and I didnt even know our relationship had already ended. What do I mean by that? Well, she and i were at a rough spot for a while. Constantly fighting constantly arguing over stupid things. But me being the idiot I was, I thought that was normal. You know?\\xa0 Like every relationship they show on TV or have people tell you, you\\'ll always argue with the significant other. That\\'s just life. That\\'s \"NORMAL\". But I was a fool when it came to this. I didnt know she and I had already drew our last breath in this relationship. I didnt know she had already moved on and found someone else. I dont blame her. I really dont. She and I had been in a tight spot for a while. Where she and I would argue almost every night over such stupid little things.\\xa0\\nIt\\'s funny to be honest. Looking back now. Those fights are kinda what I miss most now. Because with every compromise she and I made I knew she cared. Even if it was a little bit. Maybe I should have been more supportive on her endeavors. Maybe I should have been there for her. Maybe I should have continued to monitor the situation and adapt to her to keep her. These are the thoughts that keep up at night. These are the reasons why I dont sleep. Because I think about her every night. Right now it is March 8th 2020. We broke up on November 18th. On her birthday when I went to go and see her. Yet I lie here awake at night not able to sleep thinking about what we could have been doing right now. What we could have been talking about. What we could have been planning. Not a day has gone by where I haven\\'t thought about her…\\xa0\\nI promise you reader this has never ever been me. I was never one to be like this. Sure I\\'ve always been lonely. I\\'ve actually always liked being alone. To be in my own bubble. Away from society and family. Just on my own. But nowadays… while I still crave to be alone in my thoughts I get upset because I know theres no one thinking of me. I know that at night I wont be able to sleep with someone on the phone or have a night call with. You may be telling yourself \"well why dont you find someone else to do all those things with?\". It\\'s just not that simple. I got torn down when she and I broke up. I became someone I didnt even recognize anymore. When I look in the mirror I don\\'t even see myself anymore. I see a lost soul looking for something that is out of my grasp out of my understanding. Out of my comprehension of what I am feeling right now. Have you ever felt this pain?

The theories presented are of my own creation and have not been tested in any way. \\nAs an individual struggling with depression, the search for happiness has gone hand in hand with a search for survival. Strugglers of serious depression spend their whole lives in search of happiness. Depression is a journey for happiness, unique to each individual. One main misconception about \"curing\" depression is that other people know how to guide you on your journey. Happiness doesn\\'t have a formula. Any doctor that claims to have a method for curing depression is a waste of your time.   \\nMany non depressed people hold individuals to societal standards and if individuals meet these standards and are depressed, people look at them and wonder why. I\\'m not an exception. I attend a prestigious university, am very financially support by very well off parent, have never had to worry about any basic human needs, have tons of friends, a girlfriend, and I\\'m doing well in school. But I also sat on my be also nightly with a knife to my wrist edging ever so close to choosing the easy way out. I cry myself to sleep every night out of self loathing and when I wake up, my first thought of the day is is this going to be my last day? \\nNaturally, given my well off parents, I received every treatment / therapy you could imagine in my quest to shake my depression. None of it had any effect. I continued down the path of following recommendations and such on the internet and from professionals; that path drove me deeper and deeper into depression. My depression got to the point where I wasn\\'t even sure if I liked my intermediate family anymore. One day, I snapped. I just left. Not for long, only about 6 hours, but in those 6 hours, I learned more about the way life works than I had in my previous 20 years.\\nIn those 6 hours I learned the most crucial lesson anyone could teach you: you know what\\'s best for you and you alone can best medicate your mind. When it comes to your physical health, it is best to leave it to the professionals. This is because anatomically, most bodies are the same. They are made up of the same stuff and operate virtually the same way regardless of the human. But this is the exact opposite for the brain. \\nEvery brain on planet earth is distinct and unique. I would describe the brain using the 90/10 theory. 90% of the human brain is a result of evolution. We all have the same survival instincts and similar traits that have resulted in humans arriving where they are today. This area of the brain allows us to converse, eat, sleep, and do everything \"normal humans\" do. Your 90% is what makes you human. However, it is the 10% of the brain where you find uniqueness among individuals. Your 10% is who you are, what separates you from other humans. Ideally, individuals will let their 10% loose and really express who they are. This is unfortunately very far from reality. As I have pointed out and will continue to, society isn\\'t good for the individual. Society is a competition for materialistic things in order to prove you are \"better\" than someone. Due to the competitive side that exists in the 90%, societal expectations take control over your 10%, hindering you from truly being you. More on the process of taking control of your 10% below.\\nI\\'m still developing my craft as a writer and couldn\\'t find a great way to transition to this paragraph, so here\\'s a really awkward and out of place sentence. Social classes have certain expectations within that class and you are considered a failure in some respects if you don\\'t meet these expectations. For the son of an upper class white male such as myself, the expectations look somewhat like this: go to college, graduate, get a job, make money, get married, have kids, retire early because you are wealthy. It didn\\'t occur to me until my sophomore year (I had been dealing with depression for multiple years at this point) of college \"what if I don\\'t want to meet these expectations?\" \\nFor some this is going to be a lot harder than for others. Accepting that you no longer want to fit into these societal expectations will often be met with judgment and criticism from the people you thought were your closest friends, sometimes even family. I understand more than most just trying to fit in in order to feel good about yourself, but I promise you that once you pursue what you are genuinely passionate and excited about, you won\\'t care about other peoples opinions of you. The people who truly care about you will stay by your side regardless of how you live your life.  \\nIt is my belief that depression is somewhat systematic, meaning the society we live in promotes unhealthy standards of living leading to an increase in depression in younger people. Take the risk to be your own person. Own your 10%.  \\nThe 3 big takeaways\\n* \"Good\" \"Happy\" \"Happiness\" are all relative terms. Just because something makes you happy, doesn\\'t mean it will make someone else happy.\\n* This one is more directed at parents. I understand that if the child is younger it is your responsibility to raise your kid as you see fit (I am not a parent and am in no way trying to give parenting advise). That being said, once your kid reaches around college age, as I have, they\\'re old enough to start formulating their own decisions. If your child has been depressed over the past couple of years and you play a big role in their life, as hard as it is to do, you need to step back and allow your kid to pursue what he/she wants to pursue, not what you want him/her to pursue or what you think he/she should pursue. I\\'m not saying step completely out of his/her life, but as your child matures, it is important to take more of an advisor type role. As tough as it might be to watch your kid fail, we need to learn from our mistakes and learn from them.\\n* You know what\\'s best for you. Don\\'t be afraid to pursue what you love to do. Own your 10%.\\nAgain, this letter is from personal experience and everything said does not necessarily apply to everyone, or anyone for that matter.

I say \"seems to be\" as we don\\'t really talk a lot. She tends to hole herself up in her room for days on end, only coming out to eat and use the bathroom. \\nI\\'m not sure what to do or how I can help her as she is 10 years older than me. She is also very secretive, she doesn\\'t like to talk or chat much. She does not have family, as I understand it she is an only child and her parents were quite old when they had her, so they sadly passed away at a young age. We are living in Europe but she is from Asia, and I\\'ve never heard of any family visiting her. I know she has nice friends as I have met a couple of them, but she rarely goes out to see them or invite them over anymore. The flat we share is one that I found a couple of years ago, so in reality it is my apartment but I got a roommate as I cannot afford it by myself. Perhaps she thinks for this reason, she doesn\\'t need to put as much TLC into the house as I do. \\nThe issue I am having is the fact that she is neglecting on her household responsibilities. We live in a two person flat share, and in the last six months I have had to take care of probably 95% of the housework as well as the bills. This is something I have mentioned to her a month or so ago, the fact that I am struggling with taking care of the house by myself and cleaning up for two people and that I needed help. The split should be 50/50 on household fees (such as internet and cleaning supplies, at the moment, this is all on me) as well as general cleaning.  I know that she knows about this, and I know she knows this really irks me, but she still fails to help with housework on a regular basis. \\nI\\'ve seen her mop a floor for example (less than five times probably since she moved in here half a year ago) and it is the sloppiest work I have ever seen. She will take one of those dust wipers, without putting a cover on it, spray window cleaner on the ground and mop over that. The result is a greasy, slippery kitchen floor that needs to be re-mopped anyways. Or another example, is the trash can will be full, and rather than just taking it out (we live on the ground floor), she\\'ll just pile more and more things on top of it that the bag rips and the bin needs to be cleaned (again, by me). I\\'ll come home late at night after work and she\\'ll be sprawled on the couch, with the trash still not taken out. \\nThis has obviously led to some animosity between us. I work pretty regularly, and sometimes I\\'ll leave the house and see it needs to be mopped and vacuumed, and while I work the whole day she is holed up in her room, I come home and nothing is done. Even something as simple as putting the dishes away when they\\'ve already been washed and dried. Sometimes even after an 8 hour shift, I am the one cleaning the entire house (kitchen, living room and bathroom) while she stays in her room. And I never even get one word of thank you. \\nI don\\'t like to confront people, and I have already reminded her several times that she needs to pull her own weight if she\\'s living here. I think she can sense that I get extremely pissed off when she doesn\\'t do her part of the household duties, so she hides herself in her room and only comes out when I\\'m in the bathroom or in my bedroom, which only makes the household tensions higher. We rarely talk, and when she does come out of her room she looks obviously depressed. Just total unhappiness in her face.\\nI know the depression is not something I can help with, I think even by mentioning the fact that she looks depressed to her will only sour the household relations even more. I know she will take it the wrong way if I try to offer her help. My question is, how can I make her pull her own weight in the house and help me with housework when she is obviously depressed?

And it's as if that's when life felt like I had been given too much happiness. \\nI was sharp, social, fit, and cheerful. Now I'm the opposite. Over the last 3 years in university, things have been getting worse and worse for me and I saw myself slowing down, gaining weight, and just losing interest in things I used to love doing. \\nThe root of my problems are my parents. They are about 50 years older than myself (I'm 20 and they're in their 70s. Result of late adoption). I'm the only child and my parents refuse third-party help. I'm pretty much dealing with their aging on my own, while also doing university and working part time. I switched out of the prestigious program to take care of my parents, because it required about 8 months of studying and working abroad in order to graduate. The generational gap creates a LOT of problems. They get irritated and yell at me all the time over trivial things, they pick my insecurities apart, thereby destroying my confidence, and they pretty much speak to me in insults or sarcasm. \\nI don't have many friends as a result of constant moving during crucial friendship-development windows in my childhood. The friends I do have are either going to different universities with different priorities (nothing wrong with that), or they're at my university but we're swamped with work. I don't mingle with my co-workers on a personal level either. The only thing I really had going for me, is my relationship with my bf that started in first year. \\nThe past few months have been shit, with my parents getting worse at home, bf's more stressed over uni and consequently getting more irritated, and I'm just caught in the middle of all this. This past week, the Coronavirus shut down my university and workplace, and is forcing me to stay home to protect my elderly and sickly parents from the slightest chance of exposure to it. Now I'm getting a constant inflow of sarcastic comments, insults, and yelling from my parents, with no escape. I haven't seen my bf in nearly a week and he's also been busy + stressed so he hasn't been able to talk much. I just feel like he's tired of me after exploding over text tonight. \\nI don't know what's happening. I feel like every time things are starting to look up, life comes and destroys it. After months of trying, I finally got a job offer for a nice bank position starting this summer, but I was offered right at the beginning of this coronavirus shit and the HR manager hasn't even been able to send my official offer letter yet. Given the likely recession, I don't even know if I have a job waiting anymore. \\nI have no idea why I'm posting this here. With everyone getting irritated with me, I just feel like I no longer have anyone to engage with. I might've set my bf off the edge tonight with a few stupid frustration-induced replies to something he did that annoyed me. I don't even know if I have a relationship anymore. My parents are slowly dying and at 20 years old, I have to deal with this alone. I'm trying to finish my studies and get a good paying job to support myself when they do pass away, but university and everything is closed indefinitely and my new job that would've started my career path is probably gone because of the recession.

I was happy, at least I think I was. I was confident, didn\\'t look like shit, had quite a few friends, lots of activities, a girlfriend that I lived with, didn\\'t have a high paying job but I liked the place. Life was great apart from my girlfriend cheating on me a couple of times - one time it was \"purely emotional cheating\", other time a \"drunk kiss\", nothing too bad, right? Easy to forgive and move on. Well... you still have to cry a lot, hear out a lot of apologies, \"make a decision\" which you\\'ve already made because you\\'re madly in love. But you have to at least pretend that you\\'re comprehending the whole situation and thinking about leaving her, so she knows the risk. In fact you\\'re not thinking about anything. You\\'ve already made your decision. Life is going to suck for several weeks, months, you\\'ll have some trust issues but you you\\'ll get through this, right? Right.\\nFor a while everything seems fine &amp; wonderful. Seems like everything\\'s back to normal, storm\\'s over. But it\\'s different, weather is not so sunny like it used to. You still feel loved and you still love her but this stuff is still lingering in the back of your mind. You can hide it under your smile, under love and passion. But it\\'s there. And it eats you from the inside whenever you\\'re alone with your thoughts.\\nUntil you get another hit right in your face. This one is different, this time you aren\\'t the one who makes a decision. She is. And now she\\'s playing this \"I gotta think about everything\", \"let\\'s have a break\" game. She\\'s already made her decision, there\\'s nothing you can do and you know it. And deep down you know that her decision is the right one. You have to get rid of the trash one day, it\\'s been piling up for 5 years. But it still makes you feel dreaded &amp; hurt, it\\'s been 5 years after all. 5 fucking years.\\nIt\\'s been 2+ years since all of this happened and now I think that this emotional mess was still better than my life now. I miss her, I miss having someone besides me, even if the love is \"fake\", even if something is happening behind your back. I miss hugging someone at the end of a stressful day, I miss feeling safe, even if this feeling is just an illusion. Life has changed a lot during these 2 years - I made an incredible career, I\\'ve lost some friends but I still have a couple, tried dating and I wasn\\'t too successful. I gained some weight (not obese in any way, just overweight), lost all of my confidence, now I\\'m not as extroverted as I used to be, I\\'m still assertive &amp; confident in my work environment (which contributed greatly in my career) but I\\'m pretty shy in any other social environment, I started smoking and I really hate who I am now.\\nAnd I\\'m trying to change it. I started going to the gym, didn\\'t stick to the schedule at first. I relied on my gym-buddy too much probably, didn\\'t want to go alone. Started over after a break of 5 months, going alone now and I really started liking it. Well apart from feeling lonely all the time. Either way, COVID-19 comes, town\\'s in quarantine, gym is closed. Always getting into some kind of obstacle. At least this obstacle is the real one.\\nEither way, during these 2+ years (maybe even 3 years), I was feeling worse and worse each day. The life seems to go nowhere. I have nothing and no one and I honestly don\\'t even believe that it\\'s going to change. I\\'m staying alone most of the time, I want to do something, I want to have friends, to be between people. I want to find new hobbies, new activities, be more positive, outgoing, confident. It seems to be so easy to everyone but not for me. I occasionally see people having first dates in a restaurants, couples going through the aisle of the supermarket while holding each other\\'s hands. I miss those things. I miss my old self. Nobody likes my current self, even I don\\'t. And I probably can\\'t even expect other people to like me.\\nBut one day, quite recently, I woke up in the morning feeling... different. For the first time in 2-3 years I had a positive outlook, I felt confident. It seemed like it\\'s all going to be well for me. It was like jumping from one really cloudy &amp; sad universe to the one that\\'s sunny. Needless to say, it didn\\'t last longer than a day. If it lasted longer, I wouldn\\'t be writing this terrible post here...\\nI don\\'t know what to do. I don\\'t know how to change. I don\\'t know how to find these bits of \"old me\" in my brain.

When we broke up, her new guy wasn\\'t the best looking guy in the world and now he has posted pictures from the gym where he\\'s fucking ripped. He progressed forward with his life and now I look at myself in a hypothetical mirror. And I\\'m still depressed piece of shit, stuck in time since 2 years ago. Will something change? Or I\\'ll have to live miserably for god knows how many years, still being stuck in 2018 when my life took a 180 degree turn? Or maybe I\\'m making the progress?

A letter to my dad. : You told me to be honest with you, and I tried to be, but all that did was make you disappointed and upset that I wasn't turning out the way you wanted. When I was honest about my flaws, instead of supporting me, all you did was feel disappointed and dug the knife in deeper, every time. You get angry when I close myself off, and you are upset when I open up. \\nI can't help feeling afraid, I'm not as perfect and as achieving as you are. Believe me, I wish I was, and I can already tell that despite all the effort I put in to have an honest discussion with you some days ago when you were upset and angry, you didn't hear a single thing I said. And you obviously don't remember any of it. Your mind somehow can't comprehend anything about me, any of my flaws, the way my mind works, or literally anything about how people work except from your own perspective. How dare you tell me that your life has been awful and that you've suffered. I know you have, and I sympathized once upon a time, but quite frankly I've never received emotional support from you. And despite the craving in my heart for acceptance from his father I know I never will. \\nI wanted to do this for you today because I wanted to show I care, but it turns out that it didn't matter. You were going to be upset and unhappy anyway, no matter what I did. Yes, I was thinking of trying to go driving today, and to practice and everything, but I guess it never mattered.

For real this time, I'll have a last day with everything I wanted to do, and then I'll ditch my phone somewhere north and go as far as I can go without anyone else finding me. I think that's fine. It's just hard to rationalize because I'm still making plans with people for next week. Hard to have to explain to them, and I guess to you, how much I will miss being alive. I want to blame you for this, and there's a part of me that wants to hurt you in retribution for all the pain you've caused me that does, but I know it's pointless, both because you wouldn't understand what I meant, and even if you did you'd never be able to comprehend what you've actually done to me. I should know, I've tried explaining to you. I guess common sense really doesn't apply to everyone, huh. \\nI don't really want anything sweet for my birthday. If I had to pick a present, it would probably be something like, being happy. Or not wanting to cry so often. Just something small, for me. \\nThere's so much I really wanted to have said, but I guess that's fine. I don't even know if I hate you, because I don't think that's true. Maybe I do, but I feel guilty about it, because it really isn't entirely your fault. It's a frustration that I was born without parents that understood me, and a world that had no place for me, that I was forced to carve my own path through, and yet it burdened me with things that took away my ability to do so. It feels unfair, but I know you don't care, you never did about the suffering that you saw was beneath your own experiences. I know you never truly understood my struggle with fighting for my own existence, because you flew through it without taking a scratch yourself, and you should be proud of that achievement. If I offer some advice however, maybe don't look down on those who are not having as much luck as you did in getting through your trials. \\nI don't know, my suicide might be a wake up call for you, but I highly doubt it.

I drop little hints all over the place hoping that someone will latch on, but no one notices. Whenever people ask me how I am I'm screaming in my head that I feel really bad, but I say that I'm fine. I've even tried writing a note but I chickened out of putting it down because I didn't want to make my family sad. I feel like at this rate, my family will never know how I truly feel.

I'm 21 years old, I have never been on a date on my life since I was homeschooled and very socially awkward. I've been using dating apps for two years with no luck until I matched with this girl a few weeks ago. We talked and chatted over the phone and things were looking well, we even had a date scheduled. But the day before, she messages me saying that she's not ready for a relationship.  I told her I understood, I didn't want to be a dick about it. But deep down...I felt pretty hurt. I was almost there, and the rug was pulled under from me. It felt like God's cruel joke. I'm not mad at the girl or anything because she's not obligated to date me (although I do wonder why she was on a dating app in the first place...?); but I will say it hurt a bit. We haven't spoken since.\\n2) My job. It fucking sucks. I'm a pizza delivery driver and I hate it. Customers are rude and the managers keep pressuring me to do everything faster. I'm autistic and I'm really not meant for this kind of work environment, but my parents charge me rent so I really need a job. They keep making me answer the phones even though they know how much social anxiety it gives me. I showed up late to work the other day and got a warning that next time I'll be written up and honestly...I don't care anymore. But I've realized I might be doing shitty jobs like this for the rest of my life, all this meaningless toil just so I can survive. It's so pointless. So fucking empty.\\n3) I had to cancel a film shoot for a movie I've been making. This is the third time I've had to cancel it and I've been working on this one scene for MONTHS. Why?

Yesterday, my bar announced that it was closing for the next 'week' and the Taoiseach hasn't officially put us into lockdown yet but we will be by Tuesday apparently. Social gatherings were banned, public places were told to close and we're all obviously being told to stay the fuck indoors.\\nNot only am I worried about the fact that a pandemic the likes of which has never been seen in history is encapsulating the entire planet, or for the safety of my loved ones, friends and colleagues or the fact that I now have no job, no savings and no way to pay rent on the first, the thing that I am most afraid of losing is my sanity. \\nI grew up in an extremely difficult household, my parents were verbally, emotionally and physically abusive. My dad was only ever there to hurt us or shout at us and my mother is an alcoholic. My older sister left the second she could and my older brother withdrew to avoid them so I was left to raise my little sister as best I could. \\nI've had depression for as long as I can remember. I was diagnosed after an overdose at 15 and psychiatrists have always told me that it seems I had depression since I was a young girl. I didn't even know that was possible. It's eaten every inch of my mind, my body and my life. \\nIt affects every single tiny little thing that I do - good or bad. I have trust issues, abandonment issues, self hatred, an eating disorder and a very bleak outlook on life in general. Or I should say I did. \\nLast year was the worst year of my life by far, it all just seemed to come to a head and I grew so frustrated with it that a miracle happened. I had to do something to change it. \\nOkay no, not a miracle. I've been in and out of therapy since I was 15 and I've been on antidepressants on and off the whole time too. Four years ago, I found my therapist Amy and it changed my life. I've been seeing her at least once a week since and I've been back on meds for the last three or so years too. I've made so much progress and worked so hard and gotten so far that this year, I felt happy and settled enough to come off my medication and even take a break from therapy! \\nAnd I've been doing great! I'm literally a new person, if it comes up in conversation with people that I have met this year, they are shocked at my background and history with mental illness! It's incredible. \\nDon't get me wrong. I have bad days and weeks still. The darkness is still and will always be there. It just so happens that for the first time in my life, there's light too! \\nSorry if this is too much, I just need to vent and I don't think I can even call Amy in the midst of this. \\nSo we come to yesterday. I usually live in the city with a couple that I'm not close with at all but they're not bad people, we just don't vibe. I was planning on staying with my parents this weekend anyway so I came after work on Friday. I had a good day yesterday, playing with my nephew and catching up with my family - we have a very strained relationship now and it's in no way healthy but to me, it's better than nothing and my two year old nephew is reason enough to try to build a relationship with them and he's the main reason I visit every few weeks. \\nI'm sorry, I'll get to the point. \\nMy family say I should stay here while this all tides over but being in this house where my heartbreaking childhood happened is always difficult for more than a couple days. With our strained relationship, I spend a lot of time here alone to avoid them and when we are together, it's often at odds. I can still exercise here, I'll probably be able to see friends and it'll be easier to see the guy I'm seeing if we can at all. \\nMy other option is to go back to my apartment in the city where I will be stuck with my housemates, which I also find very socially awkward and I'd probably spend the whole time in my room or on the balcony, alone. I don't know if I'll be allowed out of the apartment to exercise if lockdown comes and there's no space at all to exercise inside. It will be very unlikely to see friends there too. \\nEveryone is delighted with two/four weeks to sit at home getting fat and watching TV but me? It's my worst nightmare. I usually work 60+ hours a week, go to the gym four days a week and meet friends every single day. I stay out of the house as much as I possibly can because even though I enjoy spending 2/3 hours every day on my own smoking and watching YouTube or writing, I can't spend long periods of time at home or alone. \\nI'm afraid I'll be a shell of a human being either way at the end of the month and it hurts so much to know I'll have to backtrack on a lot of the work I've done already. \\nI hate this, I hate all of it and I'm sorry to be complaining about something that seems insignificant compared to everything that is happening but my mind is the only thing I have ever had and my happiness is something I worked very long and hard for - and I simply can't lose it.\", 'text_b': None, 'label': 0}, {'guid': 2873, 'text_a': \"I hate the realization of knowing that you are really alone : I know many people feel lonely, left behind or forgotten and from time to time I think so too.

Although I was 30lbs heavier than I am now &amp; really anxious about my job, I was doing well there/in my career, made good money, was headed on vacation to the beach, in a couple of weeks and started hanging out with someone who (I thought) liked me. \\nFast forward to now: I was fired from that job, then I got another job which I was laid off from in December because they got rid of my whole department (still looking for work), still have never had a serious relationship or someone that just wanted to be with me and wasn’t shy about it and had no ulterior motives, and I am beyond sad and cry every day. I’m crying writing this. I want to feel better, to stop comparing my life to others and not constantly hate myself and feel so fucking lonely that I go on apps to talk to people just to make the day go by, but I can’t. It frustrates me and I feel so dumb. \\nDating: it has been so awful for me. I know that having a partner won’t bring me the happiness I need on my own, I need to focus on myself, my time will come, but I HATE HATE HATE hearing that shit. I have been focusing on myself for the last 29.25 years, and I think there is nothing wrong with wanting to date and have a partner to share my life with. And I also hate when someone says but you’re so pretty smart and kind and alluring, you’ll find someone! You don’t know that!!!!!!\\nI have been noticeably different towards my friends. I decided to open up to one of them and now that I have, I really wish I had just gone with the “I’m fine” response. She is trying to help and I know that I am difficult to even have a conversation with right now. She said if I needed distance then she would give it, but it feels selfish to do that, so I continue to say it’s fine to continue talking. But it hurts to hear about hers (or the other people in my life) increase in pay at her job, her new guy she is seeing, how her life is going so well, when mine is utter and complete shit. And all I can do is compare and it leads to more crying. She says she wants to help me get out of the funk I’m in and that I have every right to feel how I feel but I need to be more positive. I love her and thank her for want to help, but I hate hearing that. Which then leads me back to thinking maybe I should just distance myself. We’ve argued a bit lately. And I know it’s because of me. I’ve become too attached (we talk throughout the day, every day) &amp; I get more anxious when I don’t hear from her. I tried being vulnerable this afternoon and I still haven’t heard from her. But I am resisting sending another text. I absolutely hate how much things like this I s affect my happiness. I wish I wasn’t such a shit person and friend. \\nPeople always suggest gym and eating better as ways to cope. Well the thing is is that I already go to the gym 6 times a week (sometimes daily). There around 90 min to 2 hours. During that time is the only time I am confident, happy, and determined in myself. I feel strong, capable, and on top of the world. But as soon as I leave, it’s back to shit. But if I did not have the gym, I do not know how even darker and more depressed I would feel. Also (I live at home with my parents and sister right now) I haven’t eaten more than one small meal a day really in the past 4 days. I’ve been able to hide it from them. Not that I am trying to starve myself, but when I get really sad nowadays it I think I disappoint my friend or my family, I don’t eat.  \\nDue to not working and not really having money, I don’t go anywhere. Which leads to minimal social interaction. I did not realize that it would affect me so much. But it really has. On the off chance I talk to someone at the gym, that makes my week because that is usually the only interaction I get. I go to my favorite local bar every so often and it helps just to be somewhere different. But I feel guilty spending a little money on two drinks and to socialize.\\nI do the the things that they say most people who are depressed usually don’t do: I clean, make meals for myself, shower daily, go to the gym. So then I think to myself,”maybe I’m not depressed? Maybe I’m making this up and it isn’t legitimate. \\nAnd job: I’ve applied, but honestly I have been hesitant to apply to a lot of jobs because I just don’t feel smart enough or capable enough at all. I have colleagues in my field who say I am young, smart and capable. But it doesn’t feel that way given my recent job history. \\nHow are you?

My problem starts where the it says \"my issue\". But honestly to get the full picture of how tragic my life feels right now read the background.\\nSome background...\\nI\\'m in my late twenties and grew up I  a military family so I have never lived long in on location.  At the age of 18 I left for the military myself but that\\'s when my life changed for the worse. I was abused by my sqaud members almost daily. The abuse started as general new guy hazing stuff like making my run around looking for imaginary things or orders  etc. But things started to ramp up quickly being that I was the smallest and the youngest. It started with very hurtful verbal abuse (calling me racist names, calling me worthless/a retard for asking questions etc) from people my own rank all the way up to the my warrant officer. Soon verbal turn physical and yes sexual. I wasn\\'t raped but I will not relive those memories for this post neither. Things carried on like that for what seemed like an eternity, i pretty much was forced out only 2 years into my dream of a long military career after 3 failed suicide attempts and an alcohol incident.\\nWhen I first came back I had a horrible time readjusting back to my former life. I was literally 100 pounds over weight (and the weight that I was when I entered boot camp at). I was back living with my parents which felt embarrassing and and overkill already to my already low sense of worth. I tried so reach out to everyone that I could to try to hang out with or talk but thi is always felt awkward  or in some cases I would be thirstier than a dying guy baking in the desert for months and immediately ruin the conversation and any chance of friendship.  I was so desperate for a normal sense of a relationship I fell quickly into a very toxic relationship ( I was a major contributor to the toxicity along with her some of her actions) 2 years later she ended up leaving me and i don\\'t blame her one bit. I was extremely clingy and jealous. Since I was not treating any of my symptoms of depression and anxiety I would have days where I would literally sleep all day even at her place.... which was another thing....\\nWhen I first came back I had a horrible habit of never sleeping at night because again I was not treating my PTSD  or sleeping for days like a bear in hibernation. So when I was dating her I was always at her place. On my fridays I would pack some things in a backpack and no joke as if I was a kid going to sleep over his friend\\'s house on the weekends. I would go to her place and sleep over then go back to my parents place as I worked and continue the cycle. I would have mental breakdowns at home too. I would have night terrors and periods where I would cut/burn myself leaving a couple of horrible scars on my chest/shoulder and forehead. \\nAnyways things got a little better after I went on an absolute social purge and deleted my facebook and stopped replying to the little people who texted me. I left that job and actually started to address my severe depression and anxiety along with my weight issue as well. I went to the doctors and college. I tried to amend my very damaged relationship I had with my parents and sister. I sought the right treatment which lead me to a 6 year recovery period where I lost  60 pounds and try to practice healthy habits. I quit drinking alcohol and smoking cigarettes. I now wake up to ride my stationary bike for 2-3 hours a day or go for very long walks. I currently work full time at a job that I actually enjoy. I even have my own unit in a apartment building but the only hang up is that I have an extremely hard time meeting new people or even talking to people\\nIt feels like I have all these skills to maintain myself so I avoid those cycles of depression and suicidal thoughts but gained no social skills at all. I freeze up and all those self defeating and self doubtfulness/loathing thoughts come washing over my like a tsunami. Therefore I tend to avoid crowds and gatherings.\\n_____________________________________________________\\nThe issue:\\n My problem is that I feel like a stranger in a town I literally spent the most amount of my life in.  I have no friends at all and the loneliness has been fueling my recent growing depression. I feel as if years of work is slowly unraveling itself. I\\'ve tried apps (pof tinder etc) and what not but honestly I was quickly discouraged when I literally had no replies other than bots and escorts. I\\'m left a sense of hopelessness even at someone somewhat young. I feel like my twenties has been a waste and trying to be the lone wolf in life is turning out to be something I don\\'t want. I just want to find genuine people to hang out with and talk to. I have no idea where to start. I could really use some help rebuilding a social life and honestly find someone special... \\nAgain sorry if the post is too long or whatever I just really needed to vent. Maybe my expectations are too much for myself and I should be satisfied with just being here at the present moment but the loneliness really is starting to a sink hole that I\\'m finding it to be harder and harder to climb out of...\\nTL;DR-  Military veteran with PTSD/Major Depression/Anxiety and absolutely no social skills in desperate need of help in relationship building.', 'text_b': None, 'label': 0}, {'guid': 2940, 'text_a': 'Do you ever feel that when you actually want to talk to someone in \"real life\" about how shitty you feel no one sees how important it is for you? : [removed]', 'text_b': None, 'label': 0}, {'guid': 2942, 'text_a': 'I’m Tired : This is just gonna be a rant, it’s how it has to come out I guess.

My family was worried about me. I went to many psychologists, but I did not see any benefit. My mom refused me to use medication. I didn't want it either. Because everything was ending in my head. I struggled for years. I haven't been out for months. When I got on the subway, my heart was pounding and i was having trouble breathing. I don't remember how many times I got off from the subway and got into another one because it was crowded. I forgot how to talk to people.  My hands were shaking every time. After a while I got bored with this situation. People thought I was doing it to get attention. This made me feel like shit. I made some friends. They approached me first. Then I approached them without noticing. I went out with them. I started talking to people but still my hands were shaking. I showed my real personality to people.  I don't care what they think. If I got angry, I was making it clear. I just didn't show when I was upset. I am 18 years old now. I got rid of my depression. My social anxiety is over. I can now go public. I can talk to people.

Anyhow, I've been depressed for as long as I remember and I was cutting myself for a long time but haven't in a little over 4 years or so. But lately the urge has been a bit too much, I won't lie, it's gotten easier over the years, because I really didn't want to add more scars (I FINALLY started wearing short sleeves and stuff out in public, maybe a year and a half ago).. It doesn't help I don't have any ganja, I live in the Netherlands and the 'coffeeshops' (I still don't know why they call it that, I probably looked it up once but forgot) have been forced to close down due to the pandemic, but ganja was working pretty well for me. Some strains made my anxiety or paranoia worse, or sometimes when I'd smoke too much, but at least 75% of the time it made me feel much calmer and helped me to enjoy my day at least a little, make things bearable.. I also have back pains and other random little pains that I can shrug off when I'm slightly stoned (I rarely get completely stoned, think I might have a high tolerance or something). So anyhow, that sucks. I quit drinking beer a few months ago because it became a problem and so now I'm down to only chocolate which is soooooort of comforting but I can eat an entire bar and then just feel like I'm ready to cry while also jumping all the way to the moon from the sugar rush (I eat very healthy stuff most of the time, so when I eat something chocolaty or sugary it's like..

Two of them are still in the UK (one was going to India but now she couldn't because of virus stuff) and the other is somewhere super remote in Norway (good for him though, I think) and I really miss them every day and I'm not on any social media, I don't have a phone, I only use email (I just recently started posting here on Reddit out of sheer desperation, hi...) to talk to my mom (I don't call my parents cus I rrrrrreeeeaaaally hate phones and especially talking on a phone) so I've been extra lonely.. my boyfriend has to work a lot, especially now because co-workers are getting sick and taking extra measures not to infect people.. because he works with sick kids and nobody can risk infecting them which is another worry of mine! I'm so scared he's gonna catch the virus from some random person in the supermarket or something and then spread it to the kids without knowing it and they could die from it and I honestly don't know if I could live with that..\\nOn the bright side, he won't get it from me.. I haven't left the house in weeks, months(?) I don't even know.. I went outside with him, a few weeks ago, to go to the stores.. and I think we went for a walk in the woods once.. Today I stood out in the garden for a few minutes.. but sometimes I get so nervous or scared or both for no good reason that I don't even like being near the windows where people could possibly see me. \\nI'm turning 31 next month... I thought my last birthday was somewhat of a miracle because I used to say I wouldn't make it past 30.. But also.. we arrived in Scotland on my birthday (I even had cake, yay!) and I was so hopeful and optimistic about everything.. Before we left I made some good changes, I was eating well, lifting weights, I was growing my hair and my beard (yeah, I'm a boy, lemme know if I surprised you, cus that might make me smile) both of which were very bushy and full and then I got sick, a week (maybe two at most) after we arrived and was stuck in bed for a whole week or something and it was awful and I fell back into my old habits soon after that. It all went downhill from there. I shaved my beard because it became very annoying while I was sick and struggled to eat, later that year I also cut my long hair after my boyfriend's mother commented on my grey hairs (why do people insist on pointing that out?!) and while I used the excuse of ''I wanted to try short hair'' and told everyone that I would have regretted not cutting it also (which is partly true).. I miss my long hair so much.. it was almost at the longest length I've had before and I really wanted to go beyond that.. \\nAnother random annoying thing; my twitchy eye has returned, it started a few years ago and came and went, but it's back now and it really bugs me.. always my right eye, feels like it's the lower right corner but I'm not entirely sure (haven't really bothered looking in the mirror, cus I don't like looking in the mirror half the time ofc).. \\nAnyhow, I gotta eat dinner now and this is probably not a ''little'' rant and I might delete it or whatever later if that's possible.. but I expect it to be buried below the other posts and that's fine with me.. honestly, even if people comment (hi again), what exactly is that going to do for me?

example, how is one supposed to differentiate \"episodes\" of mania / hypomania states from depressive states as a distinct problem vs having highs and lows caused by other things such as ritualistic coping mechanisms that influence personality? like if the way someone functions is relatively stable, hence in relation to having a \"personality disorder\", then how is one supposed to make a qualitative distinction between how someone with bipolar disorder should behave like / think like / function like who doesn\\'t have a personality disorder vs someone who doesn\\'t have bipolar disorder but does have a Personality vs someone who has both ( let\\'s just say ). \\nas someone who ISN\\'T diagnosed with bipolar disorder of any type ( instead have schizotypal personality disorder and major depression), but whom has met and been around many people who have had it for many years, probably the majority of them being the case in mental health groups, what i never seem to understand is this whole state dependent thing. like you either randomly become manic / hypomanic or you become \"Depressed\". it\\'s as if environmental issues / other factors don\\'t play a significant role or don\\'t need to at all, and it\\'s simply a come and go thing that\\'s 100 percent biological. it\\'s often very evident in the way they talk, like when i am in a depressive \"State\", it\\'s difficult to do things, and if i\\'m in a manic state, we\\'ll i\\'m doing things in stereotypical manners...\\nand a lot of people could say, we\\'ll, it\\'s like the whole spectrum way of looking at things, and that it only becomes a disorder if there is enough symptoms or impairment to start being considered one, but that\\'s a problem, because it doesn\\'t look at WHY the person is the way they are and it\\'s assuming that what the person is expressing or functioning like is the same thing as another. \\noften when i\\'d go to the DBSA groups, they\\'d use a scale, and eventually i became tired of giving a number, because neither numbers would fit my types of problems. if i said i was a low enough number, it would suggest that i should be in the hospital ( i had to clarify a more specific number to indicate what would be more \"Realistic\" when really the bipolar scale just wasn\\'t applicable to me ), and if i suggested something in the high range, it would suggest that i am manic or have some form of mania, when it\\'s not. so much an issue, that i\\'d be concerned about other people suggesting me to go take of my mental health first, because they\\'re too dumb to realize anything more complex. for example, agitation / anxiety / irritability / or restlesness would be considered as leaning towards mania, yet when you look at many research, it shows that those with unipolar depression can have all these issues, but that doesn\\'t make them have any sort of bipolar disorder...., you know, agitated depression would be an example. \\nnow this is just my personal observation / opinion, but i feel like bipolar disorder is a combination of biological and personality caused condition, where it can only occur in certain people with certain personality / psychological traits and biological influences. the reason why i say this is because pretty much everyone i\\'d meet or seen, as well as what research has shown about these individuals, as well as observing the nature of the condition itself, has shown that the type of problem in bipolar disorder is more specific to certain types of people with certain types of genes. and so what i\\'m trying to say is that it wouldn\\'t be correct or logical to just say that everyone can develop disorder, regardless of personality and genetic associations, and neither would it make sense for many other disorders. \\nand so it\\'s really irritating when people just wan\\'t to generalize or give a statement such as we\\'ll, just because your experience was like that, doesn\\'t mean it can\\'t be like this. like they aren\\'t actually factoring in what i said and coming up with an explanation that could provide some kind of reasoning that would answer my question in a more careful conscientious manner. \\nlike you could say, hmm..., that\\'s a good point, i\\'m not sure, i guess it could be like this or that..., \\nbut the thing is, from all these bipolar people i met and talked to, both in person and online, it was not like that at all, and that was with most of them being medicated too...., \\nand i never found someone who was different than the big 5 research either or MBTI faceats in relation to bipolar related disorders, including schizoaffective disorder bipolar type. all of them were either N\\'s / Ps and / or low on conscientiousness + high openness to experience, either low or high on agreeableness, low or high on extroversion, ( high on \"neuroticism\" ).  \\nalso as a random inference, what i noticed is that borderline PD co-occurred in a large proportion of these bipolar disordered people, and i didn\\'t find that surprising because the same has been shown in other \"Research\", and many of these people, if not majority of them i should say benefit well from the same types of treatments of \"typical\" people. like if they were qualitatively differently functioning people that much, they wouldn\\'t be benefiting so well or have such good outcome, particularly in the same domains of \"typical\" people, yet they do and my experiences with them were more or less similar. their personalities although not all the same were more alike than different. \\ni use to think i had borderline PD before i was diagnosed with schizotypal PD, until i realized i\\'m not like those who actually are diagnosed with borderline PD at all, and i don\\'t even wan\\'t to associate myself with them either. but then again, i don\\'t relate to the majority of people with schizotypal PD either, so much that i don\\'t think i even have schizotypal PD. it seems like the only logical solution would be Personality disorder NOS, but who\\'s gonna get support for that? \\ni have tried raising similar questions and viewpoints in various threads, reddit, psychforums, mentalhealthforums, and other places, but i just don\\'t have anyone else who shares the same experiences as me or thinks / functions the same way, and even if they do, we\\'ll they unfortunately suffer more \"silently\" and are not as visibly discernible, but i know that wouldn\\'t be true, because if they really were like me, i\\'d bump into more of them making the same types of points. you know, i rarely give casual generalized responses. my hope is to find a personality disorder support group in person that isn\\'t focused on borderline PD, since the only ones out there largely focus on those who have Borderline PD, which again, i see them closer to those with bipolar disorder than those with actual personality disorders...., but i guess my definition is a bit broad. i will say that i never met someone who had vulnerable narcissism or paranoid PD. i mean,  tons of people with paranoid schizophrenia but disorders that had paranoia in terms of relating to their personality, nada...., and even if i did, they weren\\'t like me, and their paranoia was more or less the same type found in schizophrenia.', 'text_b': None, 'label': 0}, {'guid': 3221, 'text_a': 'I

While her parents had her phone her mom saw and mentioned to my gf that she saw the nudes but also mentioned that she quickly looked away and made sure her stepdad did not see and put the phone in a family safe that only her parents know the code to. After she got her phone back within minutes stepdad broke it while in a argument with her which he later apologized for and promised to replace it.

It's been about a week and a half since she got her new phone and during that time she never had a need to text her stepdad and would instead call him most of the time if she needed to speak to him.

I should mention that since she logged into snapchat on the used phone I gave her during the time her phone was taken, snapchat logged out of her actual phone because it can only be on one device at a time. She later realized that her stepfather has known the password she used most of the time including for snapchat and her email meaning he could log into her snapchat account. During the time her phone  was taken she was randomly logged out from my used phone and couldn't log back in for a period of time and the time and date match to when the nudes were sent.

I’m homeless, but not because I made poor financial decisions, or choose drugs and lost everything, or lost my job. I’m homeless due to escaping an abusive and toxic environment. I sleep in my car and live out of a storage unit. At first, it was terrible. I was discouraged, scared, angry, all the emotions poured through my body. My first night in my car I ended up in the hospital with an extreme panic attack. As time has gone on, I’ve learned how to adjust, what places are homeless-friendly and what ones are not. I see homelessness with new eyes. I still wish that it wasn’t something that is looked so down on and that homeless people were not seen as “in the way” something that takes up space in society. Many homeless people have no shelter and live on the streets. Many have mental illnesses and can not afford medication to help them, so to others, they seem dirty and crazed. I’m lucky to have my car for my shelter. I have a support system of friends that I met at work that have quickly become family. I have my church family and a few individuals that I met when I first moved here. Things could always be worse. But in a sense, I feel very free. It is still hard, but I feel safer in most ways now than I did when I was in the environment I escaped from.

So I admitted myself into a mental behavioral hospital to detox. There I was diagnosed with depression and severe anxiety. \\nOnce out, I felt so much better.

When I first started there, the focus was on being a customer-facing network operations center. What does that mean? If you were a customer who called in, you would be talking to an engineer who could make any neccessary change that was needed to get your service back up and running OR to tell you why it was down if the issue was outside of Spectrum\\'s control. \\nThe Sr. Director, however, wanted our department to be a call center. What\\'s the difference? A call center is about taking as many calls as possible, not about really resolving the issue; a basic ticket-creating center. If you\\'re paying $1000 per month or more, you shouldn\\'t be subjected to taking a ticket and waiting in line. Spectrum doesn\\'t see it that way. Spectrum only really cares of you\\'re paying six (6) figures or more. Everyone else is expendable. It was utter garbage. It IS utter garbage! \\nI left my previous job because I couldn\\'t take the call center crap. My concern was fixing the issue at hand. I didn\\'t care for small talk, for hearing people vent, for call metrics, etc. Fixing the issue was my concern! I, also, didn\\'t care for dealing with customers who were stupid. An example:\\n\"My internet isn\\'t working.\"\\nTroubleshooting for 30 min. \"I\\'m not seeing an issue.\"\\n\"Well, I keep getting a message that says that the website is down due to issues with the server.\"\\n\"That\\'s not a Spectrum issue if you can\\'t get to your bank\\'s website.\"\\n\"But you\\'re our server!\"\\n\"Your bank\\'s server is down.\"\\n\"Can\\'t you change the traffic\\'s route to get to their server?\"\\n\"That\\'s not how this works.\"\\n\"I want a manger!\"\\nStuff like this was common. The manager I was assigned to said stuff like, \"Did you do everything to resolve the customer\\'s concern?\" \"I\\'m aware that it wasn\\'t a Spectrum issue but isn\\'t there something else that you could\\'ve done to fix the issue?\" \"Did you explain it to them carefully so that they understood?\" \\nHe ACTUALLY  TOLD ME, \"It\\'s not my job to read your tickets.  If a customer is upset, I have to help the customer.\" He said this to me after I told him and proved to him that an issue was the customer\\'s fault as their firewall (for this issue) was blocking their traffic, not Spectrum. \\nTo mention the kiss-ass director, he is in charge of a department that he has NO knowledge in. He couldn\\'t tell a layer 2 issue from a three-layer cake. No certification or knowledge for the department he is over. He would transfer residential issues to our team because a customer complained. The business department can\\'t touch residential accounts at all. He didn\\'t look at anything or know anything. He never fought for the department. He, actually, tried to get more responsibility added to the department that would cause calls to last even longer and fewer issues to get resolved! He AGREED to removing access to tools needed to help fix issues! All so his bosses could see that he does whatever they tell him to.\\nI hope that, if you\\'re reading this, you avoid Spectrum.

After she found out she said that it was cringe for her to talk to me, and I thought I should make it easier for her and me and put a distance on us. That is how I lost her.\\nLet me take you 4 years ago when I tried to kill myself with a firecracker in middle of a class. I was feeling so down so I said fuck it why not. When my parents found out, instead of talking to me, he beat the idea of suiciding out of me, or so he thought that he did. Ive been thinking about doing it again, but as the time goes by I get stronger.\\nMy best friend that I was talking about earlier was my emotinal support for everything. Now knowing that I need her, I tried becoming friends with her. She kinda wanted too, but today she was like a dick to me, and one other friend that talked about everything to me, gossiped to one of my male friends about everything and now he likes to joke about \"like you as a friend\" stuff. All my friends all are about roasting and I am not on the pretty side so you can imagine how much acting I do when I am around them. I call it \"\\'happy face\". I go to school feeling like shit and when I get to it I become the happiest man alive. I wish I was prettier, the only way to have real friends.\\nThanks for reading, and if you can suggest me should I let her go, or stay friends with her.', 'text_b': None, 'label': 0}, {'guid': 3603, 'text_a': 'im tired : i feel really shitty for being clingy because im such a boring loner and i feel inadequate.  i never know how to expressmyself and i feel like a huge fuck up and i just need someone to talk to rn', 'text_b': None, 'label': 0}, {'guid': 3604, 'text_a': \"Trapped in a worlld constructed my my mind. :  English is not my first language. So some of the things that characterizes me I believe are: depression, sensitivity, sluggish cognitive tempo (sct), social anxiety and asd(have diagnosis).   I've convinced myself that my version of reality is warped and greatly limited compared to the average person. Dunno, maybe I'm just being delusional. I've completely abandoned my ego because possessing one takes me to a place I like to call the abyss. This basically gives me ignorant suffering. Okay, I'll try to explain this the best I can. Several regions of my brain appear to be inactive and it's always been like this since I've been born. Due to this and the things I've listed before, without sufficient self-awareness life can become quite miserable without me realizing it. I reject my experience of reality and started considering the possibility of everyone else being soulless except me. The perfect coping mechanism! I can't validate my version of the world or other people's existences. Even as I read your comments, it will literally turn into a feedback loop to be interpreted by my brain. So I pay close attention to my thoughts, feelings, inclinations, ambitions, point of view, emotions and basically reject them. I have this constant need for stimulation(think I may have inattentive adhd), otherwise I get bored, completely empty and start feeling really . Though denying the very core essence of my being requires so much brainpower due to things listed above, and due to poor memory, I start doubting my belief.

Tbh I went through a period of time where I was depressed as well but its scary to even think what these children have went through or are going through that brought them to this horrendous place. I hate calling the sadness that I went through \"depression\" because that word just triggers me to think of everything that is wrong with me. I coped through my sad times by turning to religion but I know not everyone is like me. I dont even know how to help these kids and I dont think stuffing them with drugs prescribed by the doctor will ever help. It hurts me everyday to see them because I wish I had the power to rewire their brains and make them see the goodness in life. \\nLife is a constant struggle and is not a place I like either, but that doesnt mean you should just quit. You need to keep going. You need to find one thing and try to get to it. Just one goal. It is hard when you wake up and you dont even want to get up, just starting your day by wishing you died in your sleep, but trust me, one day you will like something about life. And you will die in the end which may make it seem like you are just living for no end goal or purpose, but I believe I am not working for this world but the afterlife, and even if you dont believe in this, just try to make it your goal to make others lives better and make others happy before you die. No amount of money will ever make you happy if your not happy with yourself. So push yourself and cry and keep going. Sacrifice yourself for others and dont expect nothing in return. The smile you give to others by tearing yourself apart will give you comfort, and hopefully make you smile one day.

And my mom met her now husband when i was about 1. i\\'m now 14. they have 2 kids together. I live with him my mom and my two brothers, \"a happy family.\" my moms husband started being creepy and started molesting me in the 7th grade. no one knew but everyone saw me falling apart. when i hit high school i started doing drugs because i have completely fallen apart and don\\'t know how to pick myself back up. I had all stoner friends and i was smoking and doing molly and pills all the time. i was always high falling asleep in class and had all f\\'s. About two months into school i got caught because i was stealing shit and money and stuff and my mom and him took my phone and i still don\\'t have it back. they found out i was doing drugs and cut me off from the world. I have nothing at this point. Then i got in trouble again cause they found my pills i was still taking. And then i got in trouble again and these are about 3 months apart, but i got in trouble again for having my wax pen. Then i got in trouble again because i got caught smoking weed. I got put in home school the first time i got caught. And when i got caught smoking the weed my mom took it to the school and made a huge ass deal about it. i had to talk to a cop and i told him everything. about how my stepdad was molesting me and how my mom is verbally abusive. My mom always tells me how much of a mistake i am and that she hates me almost every day. And i told him i haven\\'t told my mom about my stepdad and so he did. My mom told me it was my fault for him touching me. She told me i shouldn\\'t have been born and that\\'s why its my fault. She is now just being so mad at me for nothing. When everything came out my mom has turned all my family away from me only telling them that i was doing drugs for no reason. And now i\\'m the disgrace in the family.

Since september of 2019 to be precise. \\nThe attending doctor complimented my italian surprised I had been for such a short time only in italy  but as I said I'd been watching italian tv since I was a kid and it could be the reason the very handsome nurse guy commented that italian is a very wide spread language in X(my country) and the doctor laughed about it . \\nNow here comes the fuck up which I never meant to say but I said and as many times I reply the scene I regret saying it. \\nSo basically the doctor asked if this was my very first time donating blood or my first time in italy. I explained that I'd never done a donation in X because I was scared . Now the doc was very curious and a bit surprised as to why and I said that hospitals there are not very sanitary and its kind of a common fear to not donate blood . \\nIn fact this is the idea my PARENTS have and I by no means think that way. I've always wanted to do a donation but my mom and dad forbid it saying it was dangerous and I could contract a decease if I went to a hospital to do so in X.\\n But somehow I ended up saying what my parents think instead of my true beliefs and  I feel bad for putting my country down like that feeling like I am in italy to escape a scary place. I'm here because the economy on X is even worst than italy. Livin in X  is basically surviving .\\nAnyhow it sounded bad and the doc laughed it off. \\nTo top it all my veins were very small and the nurse barely could find a decent one , and he practically stood there besides me holding my arms so the pressure would be ok and the blood would flow. \\nI turned yellow right before it ended since my blood pressure dropped and had to be fed sugar water by the other nurse and I  could not even understand her when she asked if I could do it my self so fml.\\nAt the end the nurse guy continued to say that the blood was a little less than it should be , the bag was still Wrigley. And he told me that at the end it wouldn't draw blood anymore so he had to stop it there. \\nEveryone got up but they told me to stay there and he ( the nurse ) told the other donor buy buy cuz YareJare has to stay with us a little more and everyone was a bit worried if I was ok.\\nThe who thing made me feel kind of bad. Like I couldn't even do a simple thing like that and on top of it my mom made fun of me saying I'm not  someone who can give blood so I shouldn't do this a second it. \\nTo be honest my parents always tell me I'm naive and stupid for wanting to things like volunteer work or blood donation and that Ill never be mature enough to understand. \\nI feel like even today I disappointed them and my self . \\nMy dad though didn't sound so annoyed as he was when I insisted on donating blood (which is a 5 minute walk from my place so it doesn't even cost me time or anything) \\nSo in conclusion I feel like I had the most awkward encounter doing what my parents belittle me for.\\nTl,dr: Trash talked about my countrie's hospitals while being overall the weakest blood donor of the day.\\nAlso parents don't even support what I do\", 'text_b': None, 'label': 0}, {'guid': 3787, 'text_a': 'Talking : I just dont feel like talking anymore, everytime I think about it I just get chills for some reason, I dont really want to stop talking, but I feel like talking isnt worth it anymore, is it anybody out there who thinks/feel the same?', 'text_b': None, 'label': 0}, {'guid': 3788, 'text_a': 'Screw God for making me grow a beard : I don’t want a beard.

But I am unable to convince my subconscious of this. Yesterday, and honestly a lot of the days prior because I need to remind myself how blessed I am or this will happen faster, I was raving about how great my current situation is. I was viewing things from the perspective of how great things are and how much I have to look forward to. But instantaneously those feelings flipped on me today. I only have some semblance of an idea of what triggered this. I was listening to a podcast and they were discussing things they would like to do this summer.  I guess I couldn\\'t handle the idea of somebody doing something I would miss out on, and I began to feel I had no way of keeping up. I want things to come to me effortlessly. I don\\'t take into account that these people are at an entirely different stage of life than I am either. When a depressive mood sets in for me, I am unable to comprehend time. I no longer have the ability to understand that I can do so many things in my life because I\\'m only 23 and I have so much time to accomplish all of these things. But I guess the \"I am only__ years old thing\" is starting to wear on me. I have only been getting older when saying it without much to show for it. (Of course this isn\\'t true, it\\'s just the way I inexplicably feel). So when I start to think about the fact that I want to travel, or I want to make more friends, have more dates, whatever the case I begin to feel sad. I tell myself all the things that are holding me back from doing so. In my mind, I hate everyone and this is why I can\\'t do this, I have dogs so I can\\'t travel or really leave the house much, and finally it\\'s because I am broke. Aside from me hating everyone, which is a deeper darker thing, the other two things just aren\\'t true. So I really have no idea why I believe them. From this point, I began to nitpick every little thing about my life. Everything that I don\\'t yet have that I feel for whatever reason I deserve. Everything that I have gone through that I feel is a negative is now amplified by 100 in my head. It began to eat away at me. I would like to have the opportunity to travel, I would like to have the opportunity to put myself first, I would like the opportunity to live a full life. This leads me down the rabbit hole of finding an issue with every single thing that exists in my life. Suddenly I wish the dogs weren\\'t \"such a burden on me that I could travel\" though I know this isn\\'t true and there are dozens of ways I could travel despite being a dog owner. I also love them more than anything in the world and I absolutely hate when I use them as a crutch to something that I don\\'t do. I start to be unable to control my emotions and lash out verbally at them and anyone else around me. Which is a trait I gained from my dad and I absolutely hate. I usually am able to recognize it and today I was, and it\\'s usually reminds me that I need to write it out and try to overcome. But when I try to write it out, I find myself getting stuck. I start to feel like I am being disengenuous with myself, and then I get confused about the way I truly feel about things.  \\nliterally all of the things that I am depressed about, I was finding reasons to be grateful for just days prior. But, Suddenly my current living situation isn\\'t enough, and I need to go shop for furniture and decoration and then my funds aren\\'t enough and I need to be responsible and I\\'m such a piece of shit for being so materialistic. Then my body isn\\'t good enough and all the work I\\'m putting in, in the gym is for nothing and I\\'m wasting my time. Then I\\'m just lonely and I need people around me but \"the universe isn\\'t putting the right people in my life\". The hardest part is knowing that all of this is nonsense and on my good days I can poke holes in all of it. Unfortunately this isn\\'t one of those days and all of those things seem valid to me even as I type.  \\nAnyway, sorry if I couldn\\'t condense it in a way that made a lot of sense.

He took out loans expecting to pay it off because of how profitable miniature golf courses are, especially in a really upscale place like Akron, Ohio.\\nBut the story gets worse. The Golf Course itself has tons of problems. Most of the clubs aren't PGA standard. The old owner was disobeying the law and dodging taxes to maintain a profit. When my uncle became a new owner, the PGA did a mandatory inspection, fining my uncle $25k and forced him to spend another $12k in repairs and equipment upgrades.

However, I have no idea how to cope with a complete lack of interest in the things life has to offer.\\nThe biggest issue I'm having with this lack of interest is figuring out what to do in school. I'm in my 4th semester at an expensive university right now with a major in Mechanical engineering and Computer science. I am doing ok in these, but I have very little interest in either and that's causing me to lose a lot of motivation and discipline. There's a chance I'm not interested because I haven't really committed myself to either/had professional exposure, but I don't want to be wasting my family's money on stuff I'm not passionate about. I have no idea what area of study I'd switch to either, as again, I have no other identifiable interests. \\nBeing stuck at home because of coronavirus has given me some time to think about this stuff, and I am trying to figure out what I should do. I wish I could just force myself to be interested in things, but I think it's a combination of anxiety, low self-esteem, and (maybe) depression that is preventing me from doing so.

Since I had a very bad experience with side effects my first time using medication, I thought it would be good to share my tips for getting through this rough period as I try meds again.\\nBasically, I have three pieces of advice:\\n1) Go slow. Even if the doctor says increase every 2 weeks, for example, don\\'t blindly follow that if you\\'re experiencing bad side effects. Take twice as long if you need to. When I tried doubling my dose every 2 weeks like the doctor (and official guidelines) recommended, it was hell most of the time. Racing thoughts, insomnia, lethargy, drowsiness, muscle aches, etc. etc. My second go-around with medication, I took twice as long between increases and experienced only mild side effects.\\n2) Tiny increases. Many doctors (and official guidelines) recommend start higher than you may be able to tolerate. If the prescription is for 10 mg, don\\'t be afraid to start at half of one-quarter of that dose. Same goes for increases. Many doctors and guidelines suggest making 50-100% jumps per increase. When I did that, again, it was hell. But I didn\\'t know better. Don\\'t be afraid to use a pill cutter and make smaller increases as you go up in dosage.\\n3) Divide doses. If you start feeling wonky after taking a dose, try breaking it up and spreading it out over a few hours for a few weeks until your body gets used to it. There are many who divide their doses into AM and PM, and some who divide them even further. If you\\'re experiencing horrible side effects, you\\'re less likely to continue using medication, and even if you\\'re resilient enough to ride out terrible side effects, why torture yourself and put your job, relationships, and happiness at risk? \\nFinally, just listen to your body. Even if \"experts\" tell you one thing, if you\\'re feel like garbage when taking medication, go slow or go small.', 'text_b': None, 'label': 2}, {'guid': 4173, 'text_a': '18 , balding and depressed : 18 , Balding and anxiety attacks\\nI’d like to start this off by saying i do not want treatments or transplants ect , I’m not sure why but i just think they’d make me equally as unhappy .

This is my first real post on reddit. I had depression when I was younger. Under 10 I’m unsure of what age I was. Fast forward to 2016 I met this girl let’s call this person Beth. and my whole world changed. We had to secretly date cause her mother hated my guts. Some bipolar thing. I’m not sure. Anyway we were together and I kissed her and we were each other’s first. All the things. She moved up to New York to get away from her mom. She left a few days after my birthday. May 1st. I went and visited her a few times. I went in October then March then she came in may for my birthday. A failed surprise attempt. I’m always on top of the small clues. She went back a week later. She drove down for the summer like 18 hours of driving. I’m from Mississippi so it’s a fair distance. She came down, and it was clear she was not going back. We got engaged lives together had dogs, horses, chickens, cats, snakes, gerbils. All sorts of animals. We had a falling out one day and it all went down from there. She called my dad abusive all the time. She never met him, and was just going off what my mom said. That killed me inside because my dad died of a heart attack and the dog at the house ate part of his face off. So you can imagine how that made me feel. We had fights. We would get physical. I would try to calm things down and she would always jab at my dad which set me off. Let’s just say I didn’t take well to it. I always tried to make it up. We would bite, and punch. I wouldn’t hit her as hard as she hit me. I know I shouldn’t have anyway. I was filled with anger. I told her all my triggers and weaknesses. She used them against me constantly. We were in school for 2 year degrees. This last December she got her degree. She crashed her car so I had to get up early to take her to class. (She had earlier classes then me) no problem I did it without a second thought. After that we were getting evicted (we had till June to get our affairs set in order) she left and was back in New York before Christmas. I got fired from my job after this as well. So my life was terrible at this point. Fast forward to the 9th of January. She FaceTimes me crying. Ugly crying. She had slept with a guy and came to me because I had been her comfort the past 3.5 years. That was the first night I cut myself. Not to really kill myself, but to leave scars to remind me to never trust her again. I went to my care physician and she diagnosed me with Anxiety, Depression and PTSD. (Cause of my dad I’m guessing) I got put on Bupropion 150xl. I take 2 a day. Before all this he said she wanted to be friends but then turned everything back on me. It was all my fault, and I was the problem. I loved this girl. Took care of her singlehanded for 3 months while she get a job, and In school. I fixed her car twice. So now here I am writing this post. Class is hard, and I’m having trouble. I’ve tried meeting new people, but it doesn’t work. I have 7 dating apps and nothing. I am very discouraged and lonely. I miss the dogs. A few weeks ago the one we got together got ran over and she didn’t even tell me. That hurt so much. Her cousin told me at 2 am in the morning. (Beth does not have contact. She blocked me everywhere) to top it off she got her new dude to text me saying “We need to have a talk” that was the most childish thing ever. Spring break just got extended and I feel as my world is just falling apart. I have no social life. Playing video games used to be fun. Now I just find myself laying in bed scrolling through Facebook or IFunny. Even these dating apps. Nothing interests me anymore. Nothing at all. I got to my one friends house just so I’m not alone. I had to move back in with my grandma after all this. I had to move of of the house. Fridge. Washer/dryer. Hot water heater. Bed. Dishwasher. All the dishes and pots/pans I bought. Everything.

I’m really big on not letting emotions control you because I believe our emotions lie to us. But the weird thing about it is depression is not an emotion it is actually a situational thing. When you’re depressed you don’t feel. I need to be determined not to let this depression to continue to hold me away from who I am. This was gradual. But more and more I feel like myself.

For me, it came out of nowhere. Maybe not nowhere but I dont know what caused it exactly.

I mean if I say something, I might offend them or just get to close to them just to be a third wheel. Trust me I\\'ve been the third wheel of many many friend groups. I would just be in the back following them and listening to them as they talk, but never saying anything. I have had some friends that I really connected with.

I don\\'t really like talking about my issues with strangers, it just feels really uncomfortable - like I am somehow showing weakness. This applies especially as I am a man. Another thing that scares me is talk of antidepressants. On the one hand I feel I could benefit from such a medication as a tool to get things going again, however the side effects also make me anxious. The loss of libido scares me, mainly the horror stories I hear of it never coming back after cessation. However what scares me more is the emotional hollowness a lot of people describe, that when they do feel happiness its somehow \"meh\". I still feel really happy sometimes, but its very rare and temporary, and I don\\'t want those moments to feel less special. I see these symptoms a lot online and on reddit even, with warnings that they will \"ruin your life\" and that you should only use them as a last resort.

Until recently I wasn't aware of that fact which was honestly a bit disturbing to hear. Also, on top of that, as it turns out, I was medicated shortly after being diagnosed and for some reason given the choice a few months later to stop the medication (idk what med). Naturally as a 7 or 8y.o I chose not to take it anymore. For as long as I can remember I was always that kid that had some sort of erratic behavior. Anything I did it was to the max. Every feeling and emotion was amplified and caused me to act out in a less than constructive manner. I had and lost countless friends because of my behavior and never really knew why. As I got older the confusion and heart ache of not understanding why I was the way I was turned a lot of the embarrassment into fear and anger. Once middle school came around I started to act out and get in a lot of trouble. By 7th grade I had been arrested for the first time and severed every friendship I had but one. I then went to a private school for HS where things started to get better and I was able to reinvent myself. I was in a tougher area with tougher people who could handle me and put me in my place when things got bad. The trouble continued. I was arrested again sophomore year and the outbursts only got worse from there. I now realize that I was a person who self harmed.

Last year I decided to seek help because I was in a relationship with a person I thought was the one. Best decision I ever made. After refusing so many times out of skepticism I finally decided to take medication. It took two different meds to find the right one but wow what a change.

Up until I was about 17 I’d say I had a pretty normal life.  However, in January 2018 my father was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer.  He had a long-fought battle but the disease eventually took his life in January 2019.  In the months leading up to Jan. 2019, I missed a good portion of my senior year due to me having to help my mom nurse him on a day to day basis.  It was during this time when I believe my depression first was onset.  I was getting 2-3 hours of sleep at most everyday while I had to watch my father wither away.  Consequentially, due to me missing so much school, my GPA dropped significantly and I was in a dual credit course at the time with the college I planned to attend which lowered my college GPA before I was even in it.  After my fathers passing, my family began to fight over money that he had supposedly owed to another family member even though there was no proof.  This left a rift in my family and I hardly hear from that entire side at all now.  Fast forward to graduation and Summer of 2019, I started smoking weed daily just to get my mind off things.  This became an extremely toxic habit and I spent most of the money I had on a fucking plant and paraphernalia.  Finally, August rolls around and I begin my first semester at college.  For a brief period, things seemingly got better and I didn’t feel as empty as before.  However, about a month in I got a sinus infection and this persisted until February until I ultimately had to have surgery.  Around early December, I began talking to a beautiful girl who I really liked and once again I had hope that maybe things would get better.  It was at this time though I started abusing drugs and I would take Molly, Xanax, Coke, Percs, etc. to dull the pain I felt.  Fast forward again to January and rush for fraternities is starting to happen.  At my school, your social life is pretty much contingent on being Greek so it’s almost a necessity to be in a house if you want to meet new people and make new friends.  However, the process is extremely competitive as well and based a lot on connections.  The house that I’m well connected to got into trouble a day before rush started and could no longer take a new class.  Inevitably, I had to go to houses where I had no connections at and with a very large school like mine getting a bid is very unlikely.  I put a great deal of value into getting into a house because I had hoped my life would change for the better for once, but unfortunately things didn’t work out and I was left empty handed.  Additionally, all my close friends who had supported me up until this point are all now in houses and since then I have had very little contact with them.  On top of that the girl I was talking to got into an amazing house which I’m happy of her for, but this meant that I could only see her a couple days a week at most.  The week after rush I got extremely sick and was throwing up daily with a low grade fever.  My mom was worried about me so she took me home to the hospital.  The doctor told me I needed to have surgery within the next week to fix my sinuses and on top of that I also had active mononucleosis.  As a result, I missed about 3 weeks of school in February and fell behind in almost all of my classes.  When I finally got back, I had to drop 2 of my classes, putting both my scholarship and admittance into the particular school for the major i’m in at risk.  At this time, the girl I was talking to began distancing herself from me even more.  Fast forward to today, and I slept through my midterm for a required class for my major meaning there’s good chance I need to unenroll this semester now and the girl I was talking to is posting another dude all over her social media.  I’m sorry if this is trivial, but I feel like no matter how hard I try life is just repeatedly beating me down.  So here I am today.

I’ve tried quitting a few times, however whenever I stay sober for long enough the dark stuff that’s haunted me my entire life just comes back. \\nI’ve had to quit drinking, I can’t party with my friends anymore because every time I get drunk I let out years of suppressed anger and frustration. I’ve gotten into many drunk fights, and it’s gotten to the point where I will talk shit to people twice my size without any rational thought behind it. While drunk, it’s either the version of me that loves everyone and will strike up a conversation with strangers to maybe get a laugh or some new friends, or it’s the version of me that is a complete asshole and wants to beat the shit out of anyone that gives even the slightest indication that they want to fight. This is why I ended up loving weed so much, when I’m baked I’m the nice version of myself that I recognize from when I was kid. Fuck I wish I could go back to my childhood.\\nI don’t blame people for not understanding, I can never communicate it properly. Every time I’ve met with my psychiatrist it’s like I’m describing a completely different issue, I often times over exaggerate or under exaggerate certain symptoms for literally no reason, it’s like I just panic and lie whenever someone try’s to get me to open up. Because of this inconsistency lots of people just assume I’m full of shit all the time and I’ve definitely lost credibility on certain subjects. I’m only 19 years old, and I’m starting to reach my breaking point. I don’t know what is causing all of this, but there is nothing I want more than to feel consistently normal. \\nIf you were to see me in public, you wouldn’t guess any of this. You would see a nice, funny extrovert that has a wonderful family, good friends and gets good grades. Behind that mask is a lonely cunt that doesn’t fully understand other people and sure as fuck doesn’t understand himself. I do have lots of great friends and I couldn’t have asked for a better family, however despite my blessings I feel terribly cursed. \\nPlease, does anybody have some advice???', 'text_b': None, 'label': 2}, {'guid': 4371, 'text_a': 'Why do I even bother to get help when no one listens? : My sui thoughts are getting worse so what to they do?

I hate living. I hate looking in front of the mirror everyday and looking at my reflection. I delusionally quit computer science when I realized even if I make 150k a year it wouldn't be enough to support my family let alone the people in my neighborhood. I don't know, I guess over time you start to sympathize with the kid who has crackhead parents and realize, there is an unlikely chance he is going down an educated path. Just by observing those people with same scenario my age. I look at homeless people and wonder the same thing. They are put on pills that keep them on streets because pharmacies is just a business. In my city the people prescribing them just need money and a job. The thing I hate most about myself too is the fact I feel sorry for myself, there are kids in the middle East who get drugged from a young age and used for militaristic purposes. There is the camps in China where people are getting raped, kids who are being kidnapped and used for organ harvesting and kept alive. People say the world is getting better but it feels blind. I know people in Canada like to seek themselves as good, but is buying a phone not technically supporting those evil acts. The truth is those phones are being made by underpaid workers in a different country.  There's also so many other issues. Like a lot of people hate on hip hop music and the hypersexuality and hypercriminalty aspect of it, but there's so many more layers to that. These artist who need to comply to middle class market since middle class kids bring in revenue from buying tickets to shows. They get all the blame for that type of music but the reality is they make it for the industry. If middle class kids liked bubbly music I'm a 100% certain these poor artist would start making music like that. The truth is in poor areas the reality is if you choose to go to school, you won't be able to support your familly so the two paths that do make enough money is selling drugs, or making music and blowing up. The other sad truth is 1 in some big number artist make it. Look at all those artist, most of the poor ones were criminals or lived a gangster lifestyle (in this generation). A lot of these artist don't want to do that. NBA youngboy (jail, drugs, etc), the Kelly (killed best friend), Kodak black (drugs, jail, etc).  \\nWhy don't they just do pop? No resources, not enough time to work a 8 hour job, sing, create, etc. A lot of pop artist have big teams. If your a female in a poor area you're even more screwed. Most famous female artist in the industry went to music schools, were rich, and had connections. Their isn't much opportunity for them that can support their love ones. We see those who succeeded but not many of those who didn't. A lot of them did put work in too. My whole point is humans are corrupt and some people get the back end of it while others get built up from those people. The pharmacies, the organ harvesters, etc. Even everyday people are, we just been dehumanized to it, or are just blind to their actions. Anyways I ask myself, why should you live if you're just at the bottom? Hope? We see all these inspirational stories but the reality is most people don't end up like that. You have to pick a poison. In the world we live in it's getting harder and harder for people to make it out. Kids getting drugged at young age, underpaid workers with no education and no one willing to hand that out. Homeless people, being put into a loop, and from what I've seen, a lot of ignorant people judging them. Why should I live, work 5 times harder, sacrifice all of my free time, just to end up having the same job as the other guy? Also, I mentioned I hate myself even more for being ungrateful cause some people have less, but why? Why should that be okay? Why is that something you can tell someone. Be grateful, someone out there has it way worse. I disagree with telling someone that. There should be a fine line. I think kids shouldn't get drugged from a young age and turned into tools. Why is suicide looked down upon is what I'm asking. Hell, should I tell that homeless person to have hope? Statistically speaking, things aren't getting better for him. Enjoy the little things. This is where I am just being a brat, but it's hard to enjoy those things when I don't know if I'm getting food tommorow, and then I see someone on social media skiing down a mountain with no cares in the world. Humans are competitive by nature and being at the bottom you don't have many sense of achievement especially in the era we live in. It kinda gets to you. What is the point of living? Friends and family I never see cause we all have our own schedules and are super busy busting our asses off? Also people do care they just to social media to help. Reality is that doesn't help. We had a protest in my city recently and the way protesting in this era works is you make a post on your page. You can't get violent or cause disruption or else you get arrested. Therefore you just watch them as they do the thing you don't want. It seems like half the time people bring awareness to stuff it's cause it's trendy too. I saw so many post on the Australian fires, but a few on the Uighur camps in China. I saw millions mourn the death of a rapper, but minimal awareness to other things that are way worse cause it isn't trendy. Respect to black live matters but but what happens if you do that with another race? It doesn't work. Some races are getting fucked over way harder in this day and age. No one puts their hand up cause it's not a trendy movement, not to say the movements they support aren't important. 8.4 mill on black lives and less than 100000 combined on Mexican and brown. Sorry random rants in random order. Lots to get off my chest. What's the point of living. I'm a brown guy from a poor neighbourhood so just being a famous artist would be way harder just cause of my colour. I looked it up, and found only 1 brown person in a list of upcoming artist and actors list. The rest were predominantly white or black. Statistically speaking, woman are less interested in brown guys. Even brown chicks guys from other races. I'd say a lack of media portrayal has a doing in that. The other options aren't so friendly either. Go to school and not support my family. Bust my ass off, start a business and make enough money but at that point my chances are the same in music. What's the point in living?

I realized since I was perhaps a freshman in high school. Senior guys inviting me to parties, male teachers giving me special privileges and occasionally their eyes would wander away from my face. I didn’t really see a huge problem until I got to college. I wanted to date, find a nice guy to treat me right and I found it was super hard. \\nThe majority of guys that I talked to weren’t looking for anything more than a hookup. Some guys respected the fact that I didn’t want a hookup but the majority of guys would go along and pretend to want more when in reality they didn’t. When I would ask to get to know each other more before we do anything, I’d be called a tease, accused of leading them on and told hurtful stuff like “I’m sure other guys have been in your pants, why can’t I get some” do you know how hurtful that is. And eventually, complements meant nothing to me, I’d get so many and they all felt sexual in nature. They were all based off my looks and nothing more. \\nGuys with girlfriends were a lot of times the worst, if they saw me talking to their boyfriends, they’d get super jealous, if we’re studying for a test together, they assumed I’m trying to take their man. I would never try to get in between someone’s relationship and if your boyfriend decides to flirt with me, I’ll do my best to make him know I’m not interested but I’m not responsible for his actions so don’t get upset at me. And a lot of girls would just seem to be in competition with me and I’m not. Or some of them would make it seem as if they are worshiping me and it just felt weird. \\nThen things got worst how people assumed things I get stuff based off my looks strictly. Like I’m not going to lie people have given me special treatment but I’ve never requested it and I’ve never depended on it, I’ve always been dedicated to working hard and earning what I want. I remember my sophomore year I was taking a Number Theory class which is harder than it sounds. I took a test, the mean score was about a 55% and I got a 91% and a girl claimed I got a high grade based of my looks. I studied hard for that, I tried to get a group together where she was invited and she declined. On my test, the problems were done correctly, and she claimed it was based of my looks. That was just so hurtful. \\nAs time went on it just bothered, and I became depressed off of it based off the idea that I did not think I could ever find love. I’m a start girl, pretty but I felt like I could not find a guy to talk to where the topic of sex or my boobs did not come up before a couple conversions. It just felt like that’s all guys saw me for. And I know looks fade as time go, I don’t want a guy who just has sex with me then goes and brags to his friends, or realizes that I won’t always be this pretty and move on to another girl eventually. And I could not talk to people. Girls would always say they wish they had that as a problem, and guys would always “listen” and the next week they’re asking for pictures of my breast. And my family didn’t make things better either always asking why I don’t have a boyfriend, it must be so easy for me. \\nThat just always bothered me and brought me down significantly, I was never in a great state of depression but it was something that was just there and it was hard to talk to someone. That was something that bothered me until last year. \\nOne day my car battery died at school and a friend and I were outside for about thirty minutes trying to jumpstart it. But she drove a weird Jeep and you had to unscrew stuff to get to the battery so we were there for a while. Eventually this guy came but and asked if we needed help, he has a portable battery in his car. I assumed he was just another guy trying to get into my pants. But that was not the case. He came over and actually helped, he knew what he was doing. We talked a bit afterwards, found out we used to live in the same area. He’s a volunteer firefighter in the town over now and he’s an economics major with a math minor. Then he said he had to go, he didn’t get my name or ask for my Snapchat like most guys do. \\nThere was just something about him, the way he was super kind to do this gesture for me without expecting nothing in return. I was somewhat attracted to him. Luckily, I started seeing him on campus all the time and we would wave to each other. Eventually I got brave enough to go and talk to him and I did. We became friends and started talking a lot, he was super kind, funny and a weird sense of charisma. And I started realizing just how handsome he was along with his super muscular bodies. One thing led to another and we have been dating since then. This man treat me right, makes me so happy, makes me feel cared for and for much more than my body. Every conversation is not just about sex, he actually listen to me. Asks about my dreams and aspirations and I feel so comfortable around him. Every once in a while I do catch his eye wandering away but with him, I do enjoy it and sometimes his eyes would stay there a bit longer after I catch him haha. His complements mean much more to me, because they feel genuine and much more than something to get into my pants. I love this guy a lot, and I generally don’t advocate for getting into relationships to fix depression. But I’m this specific case it helped me, I’m so happy with him and I could see us lasting and I would like it to and he feels the same.

It would take too long to tell you about all the issues I've faced but in summary I suffer from OCD, BDD, GAD and physical pain (most notably severe nerve pain in my left arm) which has caused me to become anxious and depressed.\\nIn December 2019 I finally realized that this was not gonna go away by itself and all the therapy talks and CBT was not helping. I went to a psychiatrist and was prescribed Lexapro which I was on for 5 weeks (first 2 weeks I was on 5 mg/day, and then 10 mg/day). I didn't really develop a good rapport with this psychiatrist so I changed to another one who I really like. On lexapro I felt that my mood was elevated and even my anxiety/depression started to improve a little but the effect was kinda shortlived and because of sexual side effects (took forever to ejaculate) and fatigue, my psychiatrist recommended me to switch to another medication called Trintellix (Vortioxetine).\\nI quit lexapro cold turkey and started Trintellix 10mg/day instead. Once again I felt my mood elevate and anxiety/depression improve but after 2 weeks I was back to baseline and a week after that I increased my dose to 15 mg/day and the same thing happened again - 2 good weeks then back to baseline. I've been on Trintellix 15 mg/day for three weeks now and I mentally feel pretty bad honestly. I don't have sexual side effects which is great, although I suffer from erection pain due to a botched circumcision (hopefully will do some foreskin restoration to get more skin and decrease pain in the future - need surgery first to remove scarring). I still am tired and have issues with concentration which isn't great since I am in medical school (although I am on medical leave now - but I was thinking long term it would be a problem.) What is bothering me most though at the moment is the pain I suffer in my arm which was caused by a bothed blood draw (basically the nurse hit a nerve in my arm and more than three years later I am still in pain - I know I'm not the luckiest guy alive haha...). Due to my OCD and general frustration I actually aggravated that injury by constantly pushing and aggressively stretching out my arm - stopped with that now but yeah I made the situation worse.\\nThe Trintellix has helped with anxiety but everyday I am in pain and it's weighing heavily on my mind besides hurting a lot. I would say it's the biggest contributing factor to my depression and it makes me devoid of energy and I have no will to do anything - the only relief I get is when I am in my bed or sleeping. I've tried to keep up the hope that it will go away but after three years it's unlikely. My psychiatrist said I needed to accept my injury and the pain but how do I do that? I read online about treatments for nerve pain and the antidepressant amitriptyline came up often but it seems to have so many side effects... and as strange as it sounds I don't like the idea of medicating against the pain - I want it to go away by itself.\\nIn summary I am in a bad place not really knowing what the next step should be. I was planning on going up to 20 mg/day which is max dose for Trintellix and perhaps combining that medication with a stimulant like Modafinil which doesn't seem to interact with Trintellix, which adderall, ritalin, vyvanse etc... seem to do, in order to combat my fatigue and concentration issues. What do you think of this plan? I feel the big issue is the nerve pain but I don't know if you can even treat that?

I was sobbing and screaming “it would’ve been okay, I promise you. Everything would’ve been okay.” As if he could hear me. The next day, I had to leave work because I couldn’t stop crying. I took the day after that off. I couldn’t think about anything besides the fact that he was gone. Whenever I was outside I would think that everything just felt different. The world feels different and empty without him in it. \\nYou always think about how sad your parents will be, your best friends, your SO. He wasn’t my best friend, we saw each other once every 4 or 5 months. Even ex-coworkers who hadn’t seen him in a year are grieving massively. My coworkers and I arranged a dinner with his family and friends last weekend and I witnessed first hand the grief they were experiencing. 10 of us who worked with him showed up, one drove 5 hours to be there. The others opted out because they were still struggling so much (they will be attending the official memorial). My point is, death reaches so much further than you think it will. \\nI’ve been there, and I know that when you’re feeling so low, you truly think the people in your life will be better off without you. I’ve also gotten past that and have made amazing progress in my mental health journey. I also recognize that everyone has different struggles and I’m not trying to downplay anything you might be going through. But experiencing the grief, and seeing the grief that the people closest to him were going through adds even more perspective to it for me. \\nAnyways, this was way longer than I expected.

On reddit. But it never gave me my sense of self. I trusted people who ended up breaking me. \\nI don’t know who to trust anymore. I don’t think I can be fixed. I am broken. I want to have a restart on life. I want to be a different person. I want to be someone who doesn’t just spout my problems to others and caused them annoyance for me. I want to go back to the ‘me’ before where I can fake being sociable and friendly. I want to just put up a fake smile and pretend to care when I do not. \\nI am tired of feeling emotions. I want my brain to stop. I want it to not function anymore. \\nI just want people who won’t give up on me when I’m giving up on myself.', 'text_b': None, 'label': 2}, {'guid': 4492, 'text_a': \"NEED HELP COPING : I had my life pretty much figured out and together.

My life seems like a mess, I'm living with my parents and I absolutely hate them. Recently i started remembering I've been sexually abused when I was 6 and i told my parents about it, they had a very weird reaction. My mom literally said that she was too and why is it a big deal. You have to move on and deal with it. My mom has depression, I've seen her diary about suicide and literally dealt with her mood swings and silent crying periods for years. Now i feel i;m headed down the same path. I literally treat my bf like my mom treats my dad. It's all going extremely downhill and I can't seem to even get out of bed. Every day something that helps me think is literally hanging myself and that gives me this weird odd joy. I would never really do it but i can't stop thinking of it. Or jumping down. Other than that I have these small meltdowns where i literally need the smallest trigger - ie news, small disagreements, etc that make me scream into my pillow and hit the wall with it. I feel extremely irritated, angry, and frustrated. End of the day, I can't even go back to therapy soon because of the lockdown and I can't do it at home because I'm scared my parents will overhear.
