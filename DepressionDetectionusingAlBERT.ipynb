We called him Bugsy (Bugzy?) and he was the best goddamn dog I knew. One day, my sisters and I were driving on a highway, when all of a sudden we heard a thud. We suddenly lost control of the vehicle, and we were forced to stop. When we collectively shit ourselves from what the hell just happened, my sister opened her door and went out to inspect what we hit.\\nIt was Bugsy. A few weeks before, he ran away. I wasn't sure why he did, he was living a perfectly comfortable life. Perhaps he was seeking adventure? Nonetheless, we killed him. We ran him over because we didn't see him coming. We weren't expecting this to happen. We cried. We didn't know what to do with the body. She quietly put the carcass on the side of the road, as to not be ran over by others.\\nA while later, I got a 3DS and my first game: Nintendogs. And unfortunately, it reminded me of Bugsy. I wish I could have done more for that dog. I truly miss him. I would take care of him as much as I have taken care of that dog in the 3DS.

I used to live with my mother and it was hell, no better word to describe it. She used to insult me just for being, calling me a usseles son and an autistic no-one, constantly trying to make fun of me and shame me for everything she could, this went on for a couple years, around 2 or so, until finally some months back i snapped, i just couldn\\'t take it anymore. She started yelling at me for some stupid reason and i just tried to ignore her, but she entered my room and started just trowhing everything she could. My lap-top, my ps4, my phone, everything she could grab and throw into the wall was thrown. I just wasnt dealing with it anymore, the sadness just was pure madness at that point, i grabbed her and pushed her out of my room while she screamed at me full pshyco. I closed the door and hold it close while she tried to smash it down to get back in my room. She started crying and shouting to me things that i cant quite remember, at this point i was just pushing the door shut while crying. The moment was over-whelming, i tried my best to stay as stable as possible but i just felt so much anger and fear at the time. An hour later or so, my father showed up at my house and make me grab my stuff and leave. On the way to his apartment, he only stayed silent while looking at me, and i just tried my best to calm myself. When we arrived, he talked to me, he ask why did i did that and if i was okey with what i did. Soon i understood what he meant,my mother had called him telling him that i had hitt her and that i was just violent against women. My father never talked to me again about that, but afther that day things started to go down-fall.\\nI started going to the psychologist after that, my mother signed me up and made my father take me every week for about a month. There the stupid bitch talked to me about things like \"you should feel angry with women\" or \"hitting women is not okay\". I hated going, i hated going every week to be treated like a criminal, like if i was the one that needed help. After that i started living with my father, since my mother kicked my out of my house i had no where else to go. My room now is a little bed next to where he works. (He is a lawyer).\\nA month or so starting to get used to living with him i was just broken. I went from hanging out with friends every day and every night to stay away from home as much as possible to stay inside every-day whit my ps4, eating and doing as much as i could to avoid my friends, since they had no idea nor i have ever told them why i just stopped hanging out with them.\\nSince then my life has been a total disaster i dont want to try to fix anymore. I tried my best to go back to the person that i used to be, but every day its more and more difficult. I was just a normal kid, a 16 year old that would play ps4 and hang around with friends during the week and go partying some saturdays. Now im just a sad fucker, i still hang around with friends but i just dont feel the same anymore, i used to be the one that made everyone laughed and now im just the one that stays behind silent and laughs a little every now and then. My friends have noticed this but every time someone asks me \"is everything okay?\" Or \"are u fine?\" I just do my best to keep them away, what am i suppoused to say? That my mother is a psycho that kicked me out and my father beats me everythime he gets mad at me? I feel so ashamed, i feel so sad and angry, and i have to put all of that behind a mask of \"na bro, im fine, just sleepy\" and pretend im alright.\\nLike i said, my father gets angry at me for almost no reason, he hates that i play ps4, he hates that i go partying even tough he knows that i have always been really mature with the alchochol and that i have never ever had problems with it. There are nights where he just arrives from the job and sitts next to me, just to give me a large speech of how pathetic i am and how i will always be alone for the kind of person that i am, how no one will ever love me and how i will be left alone once he kicks me out of the house. I just do my best to cry as silently as possible, pretending that i dont care.\\nAll this happened in the summer, so when i had to come back school (i am from Argentina) i had to face my mother again. At my school, wich is the only thing i really care, you have to sitt for an exam to enter another year. This exam is really easy and i have always been a good student so it hasnt ever meant a real deal to me, but this year was different. My mother called my father and told him that if i didnt passed this exam she would make sure that i got kicked out of school, so my father made me stay home for two hole weeks \"studying\" while my mother called him every few hours to \"check on me\". I passed this exam with a 10 (A+ i guess) but those weeks were a nightmare, my father was all day yelling at me to keep studying and to focus or i would go to another shitty school. Those nights were when all the reason why i write this began, the suicidal thoughts\\nEvery night since those nights i cant avoid but think about how tired i am, how much i want to die and i really mean it. Every day i arrive home knowing that mu father will look at me into my eyes and give me that disaproving stare he always gives me. Every night i feel the door opening i drop my phone and pretend to be asleep so he doesnt talks to me. His words are knives into my very soul, i cant have peace anymore. Every time i look myself into the mirror i see everything that my father described, everytime i have time to think i just hear his words repeating themselves again and again, remembering me what i am and how little i deserve from others\\nI had dreams of being a doctor, i dreamed of finishing the book i was writing and i dreamed of getting to know someone else. Watching my ex next holding hands with another dude was like a bullet on a dead-body. It hurt, it really did, but at the time i was so fucked up that it meant nothing to me. Of course she gets to know someone new, she arrives home with a lovely mother and a care father that both treat her with respect and love. If i didnt had parents that hatted me i would be even better than her, but i am not, i am just a sad fuck that \"can\\'t get over it\" and she gets to laugh with her friends about me every time she sees me.\\nLast-night was when i snapped again. My father came to me while i was having dinner alone and he told me that he doesnt want me to be with him anymore. He says that i dont help around the house and that i am just wasting his money and his time. He told me that he is going to send me back with my mother and that i dont get to decide if i wnat it or not.\\nI dont want to go, but i dont want to stay neither.

I struggle every day to make the decision to go to school when I just wanna stay in my car and listen to music.\\nThe whole day goes like that. I even find myself struggling to find the motivation to go to bed.

I’m not allowed to go to school, or out for that matter for 30 days. A whole month. I thought, maybe 30 days of free time will allow me to improve myself/learn new skills and such. The problem is one of the MAJOR triggers for my depressive episodes is isolation. My group of friends are the reason I have been recovering. Now that I can’t see them for a month I’m honestly scared. It’s been four days now, and it doesn’t feel that bad yet. I just remember the last time I had a huge depressive episode due to isolation, and it’s pretty traumatic. I gained weight, had social anxiety, could barely talk or move around. Like I was glued to the bed. I hope this time it’s different. If it hits again I don’t know what will happen, what I’m going to think, whether I’m going to start harming myself again. Myself right now thinks and views life different from myself in a depressive episode. It’s scary because it’s like that’s a completelt different person that I can’t control. So i have to prevent it. I need to see someone I know. Thirty more days to go and then life will be back to normal.. hopefully.', 'text_b': None, 'label': 1}, {'guid': 87, 'text_a': 'Everything : I just can’t think clearly right now, so I need to say it. At some point I needed to say it. I don’t know if you reading this knows me, or your trying to size me up, or if you’re just a stranger passing by looking for, I don’t know, whatever, but I’m about to just say everything about me. As much as I can at least. All of my worst and everything. I just needed clear my head. This is probably gonna be a long one\\nAs a basis I need to start by saying, I don’t know what’s wrong with me, like if everything I think is because I actually have some sort of problem or if I’m just faking it? Who knows. Maybe I am just faking it for whatever reason, because it’s a lot easier for me to pretend something is inherently wrong with me and not that my actions are the direct cause of how I feel, which they are, but still the thought that I am not in control makes me feel a bit better? Who knows\\nWhat I do know is that I’m definitely not normal. I’ve always felt a diluted sense of emotions. Sometimes I’m just unable to truly feel, and I doubt whether the emotions I do feel are real or figments that’s I’ve conjured up. I’m definitely an apathetic person, without care for really anything, having to force myself to care about goals or people. And so I find it difficult to empathize with others, in fact I find it impossible to truly connect with others. Because I don’t care about the people I should care about. I have a long history of hurting those I care about, abandoning them or saying hurtful things because I want to see them hurting. I don’t really know why. Maybe I’m just psychotic. But I never truly felt bad for others even when I know I should. I just don’t feel capable of caring about people. But I’m not entirely emotionless either (apparently I can’t even commit to that). I do feel severe guilt in honesty. I feel guilt that I don’t care as much as I should. I feel melancholy when I realize I don’t have as strong of a connection to people as I should. I wish I could just have normal attachments and sentiments to people but, people come and go, and I simply could not care in the slightest. But it hurts me to realize that. To realize that I should care but I don’t. And I feel pity for those who care. Which is why I try pushing people away. Because I don’t want to hurt them, but I know I will. So I keep them away from me so they don’t have to hurt. Whether if that’s because I do care about their feelings or to simply avoid feeling guilty I don’t know, but that’s the way it is. So if you know me and your reading this, I’m sorry for, everything I know I’ve done. For turning my back, for disappearing, for being unable to help you, or for hurting you, I’m sorry I refuse your attempts at trying to get close or trying to be genuine or trying to help me. I just don’t want you to get hurt.\\nBut that’s just the people. That’s just my emotions and my sociable aspects of all the shit. Of course it can’t be that simple, there is much much more. Where does the apathy come from however? In short, I’m unable to care for others and for even myself, because I don’t feel attached to anything. I mean I literally don’t feel attached to myself. For visual reference is feels like I’m a ghost attached to a host which is my body. I feel a strange disconnect to myself and to the world. I feel as though I’m not the person I see in the mirror. Almost as if I’m simply an observer of my own world, of my own story. I feel like I have no true control but only the illusion of control. I feel trapped and I feel detached. Sometimes I even feel PHYSICALLY detached. Sometimes I feel as if I’m being pulled apart from my body, I feel lighter and I feel numb and cold. So it feels like I’m not me if that makes sense. So how am I supposed to be attached to things in a world that doesn’t seem real? It feels like I’m reading a story, I read the lives of these characters and for a time, I enjoy it and I care for these people. However it’s a fake emotion, because these people simply aren’t real, they are fictional characters in a fantasy world. That’s what everything feels like to me, like everything doesn’t matter because it’s all fake, because it feels like it’s all fake, so why should I give a shit? \\nAnd the apathy is one of the worst things. It makes me unmotivated and it makes me not do the things I do want to do. I can’t solve any of my problems because I don’t care enough to try. I waste every opportunity handed to me because I couldn’t give a shit. So not only am I a mental fucking mess, I’m also just a shitty person. A person who both, doesn’t care about others, and doesn’t contribute. And it’s not as if I can’t achieve. So much feels as if I can accomplish without trying, how I made it thus far. I’ve managed my way through school without even trying, usually doing better than a lot of the students. I am and always have been able to learn quickly and I could’ve been an amazing student, however I don’t care enough to make that a reality. So many times teachers tell me of my potential, that wasted potential I was given that I refuse to do anything about. Because I simply don’t give a shit about myself or others to make it a reality. And so I waste time, and I waste resources, and I am a waste of just everything ever handed to me. I refuse to let others waste their time on me because I don’t see the point. I hate when people try to help me because I won’t change, because I don’t care enough to change. So if you read this and think you want to try and give me advice or try and “save me”, don’t, because you’ll just waste your breath. It won’t change me, because I don’t want to change, I think of myself as too much of a waste to get help. I’m too far gone, it’s too late. So please. Save yourself the bother, don’t even try to help me. That goes for both strangers and my friends.\\nEven now I’m getting tired of writing this, because I know it doesn’t matter, it’s just me talking to no one. If you’re actually reading this, and for some reason you care, don’t, because I don’t even care so why should you?  I know it’s just me rambling, it doesn’t even make sense probably. I’m speaking to the void, to an audience I don’t know. It doesn’t matter anyways. There is so much I want to say so many thoughts but I just don’t know what they are they over take me. So this isn’t everything as I wanted it to be but I guess it’s enough. It doesn’t matter\\nHowever I want to leave with one last note, one important thing I just NEED to say. I don’t know how I’ve made it this far. I don’t know why I’ve made it this far. I don’t know why I wake up or what I’m planning on going for or how long I’m going but I just keep going. I’ve tried to kill myself. Even now I want to kill myself. I want to grab a rope and walk into the woods, and never come out. It’s just the way I feel. I’m tired of living a life where I’m not happy, and I’m not going to be happy, where I don’t care and I won’t care, where there is nothing and there is going to be nothing. What’s the point! I want to disappear, I wish I could just stop. I wish I had died to those pill all those years ago, I wish the rope hadn’t snapped I wish I could just do it. But I’m too much of a coward. Because I know I need to die and that it’s fruitless to keep going but I just don’t. I don’t know what the point of any of this is. The letter or my life. I just want to die.

(Long post) (pityparty rant warning) : Hey I just wanted to thank you in advance if you end up reading all of this. I also want to apologize because I don\\'t think anyone should read this as it\\'s going to be very negative and depressing so back out now if you don\\'t want to feel disgusted and shameful to be a human because of this post.\\nAnyway here goes I guess. I\\'ll try to to organize this as best I can, but I\\'m in a pretty emotional state right now so it might be messy or hard to read. \\nSo I feel like either:\\nA. My parent or parents have fucked me up due to either awful parenting or non existent parenting. I\\'ve never had my biological father in my life. Just countless men that didn\\'t really care about me and just wanted my mother for sex before they could leave and move on to the next mentally unstable single mom. One of them I thought was my real father until I was 8 years old which kind of fucked with me when I found out that who I thought was my father was actually like the 5th or 6th man she\\'s been with at that point. I even called him \"dad\" for years. I can\\'t imagine how he felt having this kid he wants nothing to do with call him their father. I kind of feel bad for him looking back on it. Maybe I was just a really stupid kid and that was my fault for getting attached to someone that didn\\'t give a fuck about me.\\nMoving on though. Getting off topic a bit. More behind point A. My mother since I was maybe 2-4? Has been an extremely narcissist drunk/druggie with mental issues that has only ever cared for herself. She sure could put on a good show in front of others to make it seem like she was the world\\'s perfect parent, but once back home it was \"I want nothing to do with you, leave me alone and go play your games or something so I can drink my pain away\". This left me feeling, yet I didn\\'t realize it at the time or even know I felt this way that it was my fault that she or my real father didn\\'t love me. Why else would he not be in the picture and she wants nothing to do with me? Obviously it\\'s my fault right? I hate myself today, but feel so much love and feel so sorry for that kid back then. Sigh... \\nMessed up the post a bit so it may be out of order of how I intended it to be so sorry for that. \\nFrom a young age I feel like I\\'ve had the idea \"ok, nobody cares about you, you\\'re all that you have and it will always be that way\". All of this started fucking with my head especially when I would see kids with their extremely loving and caring parents just enjoying life like it was so natural for them. I would think \"yeah there is definitely something wrong with me. That\\'s why these kids are loved and I\\'m not.\" I\\'d see kids make mistakes or anything that kids will obviously do because they\\'re kids, and still be loved the same regardless of what they\\'ve done. I on the other hand would make a mistake or do anything kids do and it would become the end of the world. \"You broke something? You\\'re so fucking stupid! Why the fuck were you so clumsy?!\" Or \"You don\\'t want to come to church with me every Sunday to be forced to believe in something you truly don\\'t?\" \"You\\'re ruining my perfect social image\"! She didn\\'t actually say the last part but you know what I mean by that. \\nShe would tell me how ungrateful I am everytime I wouldn\\'t do something she said. \"You wouldn\\'t even exist because of me.\" She thought that since she birthed me, she owned me and treated me like I wasn\\'t my own person. She would say \"I brought you into this world and I have the power to take you out of it.\" I became very lost and confused from a young age. \\nIt also doesn\\'t help that my mine and my brother\\'s only parent, yeah I didn\\'t mention my brother yet, but he is from a different father as well so we are half-brothers both without fathers and stuck with our unfortunately biological mother. Thank god I had him and he was street smart because he kept himself and I alive. Anyway she ended up abandoning us one night when we were 10 and 14. Me 10 him 14. We were hanging out with his friends one night and when we went back home the house was locked and she was nowhere to be found. I of course blamed myself. Sigh... Turns out she just left the state without telling anyone. My brother\\'s friend\\'s mother offered us a place to stay until she was heard from and we had to live with his friend for 6 months before finally hearing that she was in rehab.\\nOr maybe it was option B: I was fucked up since birth and they never told me anything and just pretended like I was normal, but deep down they knew the \"truth\" and loved me less for it and treated me accordingly. I have no clue if there is something wrong with me to this day or not but honestly even if there wasn\\'t I feel like I\\'ve become fucked up and now something may be wrong wrong with me regardless because of point A. Either way I feel fucked. Too fucked to ever live a normal happy life. To do the things most take for granted. To find love, get a job, start a career, to live with my partner, develop hobbies, enjoy life, etc.\\nI\\'m 19 years old and I\\'ve never been in a loving relationship, yet desperately craving to be in one. I know it is unrealistic for someone like me though so I try to say \"Hey life\\'s unfair, you\\'re just one of the unlucky one\\'s. Deal with it.\"\\nI\\'ve never had a job. Fear, depression, anxiety, and insecurity, along with who knows what others mental issues I may have have prevented me from trying to get one. I don\\'t think I even meet the qualifications for a McDonald\\'s crew member. Which leads me to the next point.\\nI failed the 7th grade and dropped out in 9th. I\\'m not sure if these were because of A. Fucked up childhood and the mental issues along with it. Or B. I\\'m just retarded and I\\'m destined to live an unhappy unsuccessful life because of it.\\nI have nothing good in my life it seems. I just want to idk maybe love someone and be loved by someone. I want to fall in love, go back to school, maybe college, get a job, maybe a career or trade, and start living my life happily and free and most other things people take for granted like it\\'s just like breathing to them. But is it too unrealistic for me? Will I be alone and like this until I die? God I hope not.\\nI know I should seek therapy but I feel so fucking afraid. Like I\\'m too far gone and I\\'d just embarrass myself and be laughed at for someone like me even trying to be helped.\\nAnyway this post is getting long so I\\'m going to have to cut off some bits. I have so much more I wish to type but it won\\'t fit and may be way too long to read. So I thank you again if you read this and sorry if there isn\\'t much to go off, I wish I could add more, but there are even things that I probably don\\'t consciously remember that are still fucking with me soo..

If we are more mentally stable we can do almost anything. But if it's unstable, an infinite amount of things become impossible. When someone's mental health starts to deplete, they start to lose memory or not remember things properly. It annoys us just as much as everyone else. \\nWe get agitated quickly. Focus too hard on a question or task. Get distracted too easily. Telling a story that would usually take 5 minutes would turn into 15-20 minute stories. Our mood changed too quickly for our own good. We can go from being overly active one minute to laying in bed for 3 days straight. Company is somewhat good, if around the right people. And relationships are probably the hardest thing to ever keep up when your mental health is unstable. We end up more often than not destroying the relationship and pushing them away for good. And when you push away the person who is supposed to help and support you, there is something wrong, but you can't do anything to stop it.\\nNow self harm can be a lot of things. It can be the obvious like cutting, overdosing, or other things alike. But it can also be things like; getting a tattoo or piercing, scratching or picking a scab on your body, plucking or pulling out hairs, getting into a bath or shower that's just a little more on the hot side, not eating, eating too much, biting your lips, pushing loved ones away, or anything else which seems mundane or not self harm-ish. To some degree, every single person has self harmed. Some worse than others, of course. Some have reason, some don't. And there are people and things out there to help. Not all methods work, but they're there anyway.\\nWhen someone's mental health is going downhill or spiralling, the best thing you can do is try to support them and be there for them. I am guilty of pushing the one person I love away and making him hate me so much that he didn't even want to hear my voice on the phone, and now we are no longer together.

This won´t solve your problems but can make somethings clear. \\nYou , like anyone else, were brought into this world and you embodied specific body characteristics , home environment , family , local community , physical and mental skills that you did not choose. This makes it look that our lives are not so free as we think. Everyone has a journey, a wound and a purpose in life. Anything that is alive , even if it is for one second , will impact in the universe in some way.\\nWhy would someone be born into this world and repeat the **same type of  stressful situations over and over** ? Well, like i said, everyone has a **journey** and a **wound** and a **purpose**, we need obstacles and adversities to progress towards our purpose.\\nWhat is the point of being born in your best self? What is there to achieve if i already know what i need to know? Exactly! **You are born to face certain obstacles that will make you learn  certain lessons in life so that you can progress**. You need to let go of the pain and go against the other direction, the right one. I do not mean resistance, but acceptance.\\nLife gives us the exact tools for us to achieve our unique purpose ,it presents us with our skills , when the time is right it shows us the right people and situations to progress, otherwise you will be stuck in a never ending loop.  \\nIn the end, after every chapter in your life , you will dispose what you don´t need anymore for your progress.\\nEvery living thing ,dies every day, we die every day, we dispose of the yesterday and embrace the tomorow, while living and experience the today. **It´s when you hold the yesterday that pains and stagnates people.**  \\nWe can conclude from this that **we grow from hardship and not from stagnation.**\\nAbout other people, when you see someone that has a certain opinion , acts a certain way  that goes against your way of being , ask yourself what did this person had to go through to end up like this? You need to accept that people are the way they are, but this does not mean that they have the right to do what they want. Know and love who people are , but if needed put them in their place or stop them. Don´t ruin yourself for others, just accept them.\\nAbout depression, let´s be honest, it´s ugly and highly unappealing, but there are times that you need to be thrown to the floor so that you can get back up.We are attracted to smiles , confidence, people who take care of themselves and we reject the opposite , this is mostly unconscious ,but it is in our biology.  \\nThe way you view life will attract like minded people and situations, like i meant earlier, **chaos attracts chaos , self-love and acceptance attract self-love and acceptance.**\\nThere are certain things that makes men and women more attractive , like having a good/straight posture and not being curved, shoulders down or keeping good amount of eye contact when talking to someone instead of not looking at all. Fight for yourself, get a house if you can, get a job, it doesn't matter, just fight.  \\nDon´t be sloppy , don´t let go of yourself because you are feeling down.

I struggle with suicidal thoughts at times because I cannot imagine living like this for the rest of my life. I can't even bring myself to cry anymore. \\n5. I have so many goals I want to meet but I don't have the strength or ambition to pursue them. This makes me feel useless and like a complete failure. \\n6. I absolutely feed my own depression with bad habits but I can't seem to change them (at least not permanently). This makes me feel like I can't even change even though I desperately want to. \\n7.

I love to look down on myself and think the worst, so how I deal with it is to make myself busy with life. School and side activities, part-time jobs and partying. But now that I’ve had extra time I get remembered of demons and all the reasons why I think I am a failure.\\nFirst, I get so surprised and jealous of people who have a good relationship with their siblings and nieces. I have four siblings, one of them passed away last year, and I have seven nieces. I am the youngest in my family so the age gap between us is huge since I came into the picture rather late. My relationship with my siblings is non-existing, and not because they are bad people or anything, we were just never close. I also live in another city than them which doesn’t make it easier to get in touch. I feel like I actually don’t know anything about them, and they know nothing about me. I don’t know what kind of music they listen to, what they like to eat or what their dreams in life are and same can be said from them about me. And the thing is I really do want to get closer to them, but I get so anxious around them and I can’t relax. I feel like a personality-less person who doesn’t even know how to talk to my own fucking siblings, and this fucking breaks my heart because I have this barrier that won’t let me just be calm and be myself. The only thing that helps me take down that barrier is alcohol, and anxiety and alcohol doesn’t mix well together. But I love the feeling of losing the barrier that helps me talk relaxed to people, the feeling to just make friends with the whole wide world. But the day after a night of heavy drinking comes the anxiety that won’t let me leave the bed and I won’t even open my phone for HOURS because I always have this fear of finding something horrible when unlocking the phone, even though I KNOW that there isn’t anything bad there.\\nWhen I’m feeling my worst this anxiety won’t let me open chats in messenger, the whole app just makes me anxious, the mere thought of someone wanting to get a hold of me makes me want to throw the phone in the lake and take a flight to a jungle were no one will find me. My mailbox, both email and at home get filled because I have the fear of finding something I won’t like. \\nI, like maybe most people here, feel very lonely since I don’t have a relationship with my siblings nor with my closest friends. I wish to find love, to go on tinder dates or just fall in love with someone from school.\\nBut I always tell myself that I’m not enough for anyone and that I am all too boring for anyone to find interest in me, and to go on a date and get rejected just scares me too much which then leads to me just not going on any dates at all. But I have had guys showing interest in me, but I get too scared and push them away by telling myself that we would not match and last anyway, or by going home together after a night at the club and not being able to handle the situation afterwards. And then being left with my thoughts and convincing myself that it’s for the best because I like being alone anyways. \\nFriends. I’ve met a lot of people in my life, but I’m not very good at keeping them in my life. People try to get into my life but I get uncomfortable and either ghost or get annoyed by them and just wish them to get out of my life even though they are good people. Or when I’m with people I actually do like I get scared that I am too plain and boring and not too exciting for them to stay with me. I get this anxiety and start to pressure myself to present myself in a way that will make them interested in me, kinda like if they are a crowd at a theater and I am the actor that needs to keep them entertained so that they won’t leave the salon. That Is why, if I don’t get invited to one smaller thing or don’t hear of something they all seem to know I take it so fucking personal even though they didn’t even mean to not include me. But since I am so unsecure about myself it tears me apart and I start to question myself, my worth and what the fuck I am doing on this planet. I suck at calling people or asking people how they are.\\nMaybe someone can relate, but writing this out calmed me down a bit and I hope that I will find the strength to come back to this thread and read the possible comments (if anyone actually reads this wall of text, sorry!) because anxiety. \\nLots of love from this anxiety filled blob.', 'text_b': None, 'label': 1}, {'guid': 400, 'text_a': 'Advice for people recovering? : I think I am getting better with depression.

When I got caught with the weed and pills I was 100% sober and the cop accused me of being high so now I have to fight a fucking dui when I wasn’t even high. \\nI feel like I could save a lot of time and money by ending this shit, I want to stay alive for my mom my dad my grandma and my pup but it’s to the point I’m feeling like I’m starting to lose touch with reality, I started seeing patterns on the carpet when I stare at it for too long and even going almost a month without smoking and  I still can’t stop thinking about it. I can’t sleep without benedryl or melatonin and I limit myself to only getting drunk every other night. I’m sick of this shit, my parents won’t let me leave the house and go for a drive to clear my head so I barely even get sunlight which I feel is making me even more depressed. I’ve had thoughts about self harming the last two nights just so I can feel something. I don’t know what to do, I’m seeing a psychologist next week to hopefully get medicine to balance me out but I’m honestly sick of trying, it feels like everytime I start doing better I’m back to square one. I’m at the point where I feel like ending everything because whatever happens when we die would be a better alternative to this. I feel like a prisoner in my own mind, my own house, I can’t do a fucking thing. My lawyer said the charges I got were bs and he can probably get them dropped but I still get treated like a criminal. \\nMy parents want me to start going to bed on a normal sleep schedule but I don’t want to be awake, I usually sleep at 4-6 am and try to sleep the day away. My parents are working with me and want to help, I said I want to look into a service dog so when I’m on the verge of a panic attack like this I’d have something to keep me calm and help me out but they said “you’ll get a service greyhound” a fucking hyper, tiny, greyhound. I have a greyhound now and he doesn’t want anything to do with me unless I have food or pet him. I really want a golden retriever since I have worked with a few and they are the kindest little pups ever but it feels like nobody gives a shit what I want or need.', 'text_b': None, 'label': 1}, {'guid': 510, 'text_a': 'Struggling student, grief, and now I can’t the help I need because my university health/counseling center is closed. : Hi, all.

I studied my Master\\'s in this country and got a job. I work in the charity sector. I lived there for 2 years. In the meanwhile, I met the most amazing man ever, we got engaged last year in September. So to extend my work visa, the first condition was that I had to get a job that paid €30,000 a year. I got another job where I worked and I got the pay I needed. It seemed like the paper work for this permit was pretty straightforward. I filled out the form till the last section. It was about how this job was advertised. The charity that I worked in advertised it on their website. I applied for the job and had an interview and everything. I WAS NOT JUST GIVEN THIS JOB UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES. I EARNED IT. Now, what the government wanted was this job to be advertised on very specific platforms like a national newspaper and radio for 2 weeks and a website for job seekers to give them the best chance to apply for this job. \\nI asked my workplace if they would be happy to advertise this job again, I would apply for it, or if they were happy to get in touch with the immigration department on my behalf (since they are the biggest charity of that country) and try to seek some help. They out right refused. I was given a letter that said that my job contract was only valid till 14/12/2019 because that is the day my visa expired as well. They would extend it if I got a valid visa extension.\\nI went to a solicitor, he said that I would waste around €3000 on this visa application, there was only a 5% chance that would get the visa, I won\\'t get a refund on the application fees and the visa officers take this advertisement clause seriously and I do not meet the criteria. He asked me to get in touch with my workplace again and see if they\\'re willing to advertise it again. They denied again. \\nMy fiance and I don\\'t necessarily have the money to get married right now. It also does not feel right to get married just for a visa. I know it would be the easier way out but this is not why we want to get married. \\nWe decided to move to Canada in 2020. Because he is from that European country, he\\'s okay in terms of Canada visas, he already got his visa. My visa to his country expired in December 2019 and I came back to my country after spending Christmas with his family. \\nIt was one of the hardest things I have had to do, saying goodbye to my friends there, my colleagues and the beautiful home my fiance and I lived in together. I cannot get over how unjust this was. I gave this charity everything I had for the last 2 years and all fucking HR could say was we\\'re so sorry. \\nI came back home to Asia, my life here is falling apart too. My parents have lived in a love less marriage for 27 years now. They hate each other, each others families. My dad\\'s been cheating on my mom for 10 years now, we all know it. My mother has the darkest circles under her eyes and her health has degraded so much in the past few years, on the other hand my dad is progressing towards becoming a full blown alcoholic. \\nThey\\'re finally separating. I\\'m glad about it. They stayed together all this time just to raise me and my brother and because of the \"what will people say\" mentality of the society we live in. My family is falling apart though, celebrating festivals will never be the same, my brother and I won\\'t have one permanent home anymore, we\\'ll always visit our parents separately.\\nI also have to borrow some money from my father to take to Canada because what I had saved is not enough. Almost every day when my father is drinking, I hear him talk on the phone to his relatives or friends accusing me of how I have made him spend all this money, how he will never get it back, how I\\'ve made him a poor man. I\\'ve said it to him that I will start paying him back as soon as I start working. My fiance is also back in his home country, working and saving up for our move. \\nHe\\'s a brilliant partner. He came to see me in my country for about 3 weeks. He looks after me, knows what I\\'m going through and he\\'s always there to talk to me or just be sad with me.

I can\\'t remember the reason behind my first beating but I remember one time, she asked me to solve math problems and I said I can\\'t do it. She hit me with a back scratcher multiple times and threw my stuffed toys out of the bed and told me that I\\'m not allowed to sleep until I finish solving. I remember crying to my grandmother and I saw the pity on her eyes because she also doesn\\'t know what to do. I always have this constant fear that when I fail a test she\\'s going to beat me up again so when my test papers were returned and the scores are low, I would cry immediately.\\nthere was a time when I don\\'t know how to do my homework and my mom was scolding me in front of my dad and I was crying so hard and I looked at him while expecting him to come to my aid but he just stared at me like I\\'m a random kid wailing at the mall. He also used to order me to buy beer and cigarettes for him and to keep it a secret. My mom and my dad also fought once when I was around. We were going to sleep and my dad was ranting about something but she covered my ears so that I won\\'t hear him. I was 7 years old back then.\\nWe moved to a new house to have a fresh start in 2008. She still beats me occasionally and I became conscious of the neighbors hearing me cry. I can still remember that I would beg my mom to let me close the door first before she beat me so that they won\\'t hear me.  I was 8.\\nI was going through my mom\\'s old phone when I saw my father\\'s old messages arguing with my mom that he\\'s hungry for sex and he just want it because it\\'s his right. Reading that messages fucked me up real good. Maybe that\\'s why I\\'m afraid to have sex with anybody.\\nI used to bring my friends to our house to play but when my mom sees something that she doesn\\'t want, she\\'ll scold me in front of my friends and sometimes get physical with me even if they\\'re around. I was 10. I never brought friends over in my house when she\\'s around since then.\\nShe would also go through my stuff especially my phone. She would read my messages and it would make me panic because there are things in there that she\\'s not supposed to see. I would become hysterical and she would just threaten me that she\\'ll not give my phone back if I won\\'t give her my phone password. We\\'ve been through this a lot of times and until now I\\'m afraid to let go of my phone around her.\\nI was always one of the best student in our class during my junior high school years but I was not recognized because I\\'m always shy and quiet.

Obedience.\\nOne of my teachers that I saw as a father figure asked me to eat with him outside the school premises and would nag me about why I\\'m not responding to his chats and would call me on my personal number when he can\\'t reach me through messenger. He used to screenshot my profile pictures and send it to me and he would leave a comment that says \"you\\'re turning more beautiful now\". He would also ask me when I\\'ll visit because he already misses me. I was still a minor.\\nThe first guy that courted me was my friend. He was sweet and was always there for me when I needed him. My view of love before was not healthy. I was raised that to show your love, you must submit. I did everything to put him under my leash and to make him believe that he\\'s wrong and I\\'m right. After months he gave up on me. Part of me was to blame. I\\'m 15.\\nI was friends with people that made me feel that what I do is wrong. I\\'m afraid to go against them because they are the only ones I got.\\nI was with my friends drinking on the rooftop when suddenly one of my friend\\'s friend followed me downstairs when I\\'m about to pee. He said that he\\'ll stay with me and assist me since I\\'m a little drunk already. When I\\'m done and opened the bathroom door, the room was pitch black and the lights were off. He was standing in front of me and grabbed my hand. It\\'s gentle but it disgusts me. I went to switch the lights on and one of my friends opened the door and said that he\\'ll leave us both there to have a good time (and by that he means sex and kissing). I\\'m not comfortable and I was shaking my head lightly but he didn\\'t get the message. The guy that I\\'m with closed the door and locked it from the inside. He said that it\\'s better if I sit down with him on the sofa. I did but I immediately got up because I\\'m not feeling good. I made an execuse that my mom is texting me and she\\'s already pissed so I have to reply to her. He repeatedly called my name and it sent shivers down my spine. I continued to chat my friends pretending that they\\'re mom and then he grabbed my arm with a little force to make me sit down.

I quit the club after a year, i guess because i felt like i didn't fit in. Looking back everyone was super friendly and i really enjoyed the activity, but i just convinced myself that i don't belong.\\nShe convinced me to join the club again, i started snowboarding again and love it, wish i never quit. But this girl, she's amazing. She's cute, friendly, funny. Just one of those people who always says hello in that way that gives you energy for the rest of the day. We're both part time and work separately; She's in the store front and i'm in the back office, so we don't see each other much, but every time we talked it was like she took a genuine interest in me. Not just smalltalk, you know? Even with the club we rarely seem to be in the same place at the same time, but then there was this trip planned.\\nEvery year the club plans a week long skiing trip in the french alps; a couple of dozen of us on a mountain in a shitty hostel drinking gratuitous amounts of alcohol and falling over in the snow. I was looking forward to this so much. I haven't been on a holiday in a long long time. I couldn't afford to go when i was in the club those years back, but most of all i was excited because this girl was going. I saw this as the opportunity to get closer, actually get to know this girl, make sure my feelings are real and maybe make a move.\\nTonight france goes into lockdown, my trip isn't happening.\\nEvery plan i had just came crashing down, and it's not going to happen. It's kind of a wakeup call, because all those plans weren't really plans, they were fantasies. I imagined us going away together, falling for each other and starting this amazing relationship that could be exactly what i need to fill this hole i feel in my life. Reality is i'm not charming enough or confident enough, or in any way enough of a catch to make it happen so smoothly. It was never going to go that way, it was all just in my head. Fuck, i don't even know if she's single.\\nI've been riding this fantasy for so long and now i'm figuring out i've just been letting my life go by. I could have been with this girl all this time, but it didn't match up with my fantasy,  so i didn't even consider it.\\nI actually saw her in work today, as soon as i walked in she started talking to me. Later i went to grab coffee and when i was making my way back to my office she called after me just to give a funny little tidbit about one of our coworkers. When i went out for lunch i passed her carrying something made of straw, she looked proud as punch telling me that she'd just bought a house for her rabbit. When i was leaving in the evening, she asked how my day was since i was alone in the office today. When i walked back into the store because i forgot to hand over the keys, she gave me this huge smug grin and asked what i'd forgotten.\\nLike, she seems to take every opportunity to interact with me, she once dropped everything she was doing to literally jump out in an isle and ask me a question. Maybe she likes me, maybe she's just friendly, but at the very least i can tell that she wants to know me and i've been doing nothing with it because it doesn't line up with my perfect fantasy.

So this is me sharing my story along with things that really helped me in particular.\\nFor most of my life I would have described myself as a happy, optimistic person. Good family, good friends, good life in general. That\\'s not to say my life was free of any emotional hardship. Specifically relevant were a couple of times I think I had a couple brief encounters with shorter term depression. In 7th grade there were a few weeks where I was very low emotionally. Feelings of not fitting in, some weird form of bullying. I remember being at my lockers when someone who was something of a friend came over and asked me if I was alright, and that shocked me into realizing I wasn\\'t feeling alright even though I just deflected with \"I\\'ve just been tired lately.\" That brief encounter kind of snapped me out of the negative mindset I was in. In that instance I think all I needed was to know some of my peers actually did care about me so I\\'ve always been very grateful to that person in a way they aren\\'t aware of. The rest of my middle school and high school experience was very good overall. The other brief encounter was just a random day during my freshman year of college. I got back to my dorm after classes on a beautiful Friday. So much stuff that I could potentially do, outside activities with friends, online videogames with friends from high school and elsewhere, any number of campus activities. I sat down and was just overwhelmed with this immense feeling of *boredom.* All this opportunity at my fingertips and none of it appealed to me at all. In fact in that moment it felt like there wasn\\'t anything in the world that would stop this feeling of boredom and that quite nearly brought me to tears. This actually scared me afterwards and over the next few weeks there was an uptick in me going and doing things I thought were productive and fun to make sure I didn\\'t feel that feeling again. I was not so lucky as to avoid it forever.\\nFlash forward to the start of my senior year of college. I had just wrapped up a typical summer working hard, spent some time camping with my family, and was excited to be back to classes. My friends and I had founded a new club at the university, the classes themselves were engaging, and everything was going great. A couple months in and things just started to, I don\\'t know, slip. The fun of anything I was doing just started to fade out slowly and because of this I started to withdraw from doing them. Less and less attentive with the club, less attentive with my social life, less attentive with classes, less attentive with physical fitness. By the end of the semester everything had *really* slipped, including my grades, and I just felt really burnt out on everything. I kept telling myself that winter break would be the recharge I needed. Some time to relax and refocus. Of course I didn\\'t fully comprehend my situation at the time and was totally wrong. Over winter break I had gone back home and spent a large amount of time sleeping/resting. Even when I was awake I really wasn\\'t doing much. At one point I had gone down for yet another nap and my mom came down and asked me if anything was wrong. She noticed the slip in my grades, the sleeping, etc. When she did that it made me briefly aware that something was indeed wrong even if I didn\\'t know what, but I of course deflected it to just being burnt out from last semester and trying to rest up. By the end of break I told myself that I should have my energy back to really finish strong.\\nFor the first month or two of the semester I came out swinging. I was extremely on top of everything, ahead on all my work and getting good grades on it all. Back to my normal gym routine. And yet I had this feeling that I was still just *behind* and despite how well I was doing, just unfulfilled. This was making me uncharacteristically anxious and would cause me to suddenly feel extremely tired. The tiredness led to slipping on things, missing classes and assignments more and more frequently. Eventually I had stopped going to classes altogether. Shortly after this I had started regularly crying myself to sleep, each time this happened pushing me closer and closer to calling my parents and breaking down to them. They beat me to the punch when I got a knock on my door and it was a police officer doing a wellness check because I hadn\\'t responded to my parents for awhile. I broke down on the spot. The officer was very respectful and polite and encouraged me to call my parents, and left shortly after I called them. The next day my mom was out at my university, which was no small trip as it was 1,600 miles from home.\\nThe rest of the week was a whirlwind that shot my stress through the roof. A lot of this was necessary, some of it felt overbearing. I remember getting texts from various people wanting to talk and feeling so exposed, as if my mom had just outed me to everyone regardless of what she actually told them to trigger these responses. She wanted to constantly be around me even though I told her repeatedly that I wasn\\'t going to self harm and didn\\'t feel alone (both completely true), and the lack of space didn\\'t help anxiety levels. However she also pushed me towards all sorts of necessary meetings. With the Dean of Students, with Student Counseling, with professors, with Student Health. Student Counseling, at least at first, was somehow the least considerate of my situation. I remember that meeting clearly, the lady doing the consulting talking to my mom and giving off a vibe as if she thought I was just slacking off in my studies due to poor work ethic and distractions. She did a 180 when I actually started talking about the gradual fade of enjoyment from virtually everything, voice quivering while I was not very successfully fighting back tears, and immediately recommended me to Student Health. The doctor I met with there was much more considerate and recognized the depression right away. More tears were shed, this time from fear, as I faced the realization of being prescribed and SSRI and becoming aware of just how much my situation had escalated. With consultation from the Dean of Students, I did an All-Withdrawal, packed/stored my things, and flew back home.\\nThe next year or so was a rough one, and contained the absolute lowest points of my life. I was a shadow of my former self. Thinking back to that time a lot of it was a blur of feeling empty punctuated by moments of extreme sadness. Even now, when I no longer consider myself depressed, simply thinking of them to type them out has me tearing up, and when I talk about it out loud my voice breaks and I can no longer hold back the tears. The spring/summer which was essentially \"family camping/get together\" season was very tough. Going on camping trips with the fifth-wheel which felt like torture as I laid trapped in a setting that I used to love now forced to realize it gives me no pleasure. Family events where I felt I was only showing up to show-face while spending the rest of the time holding back depressive tears surrounded by loving family and friends. At some point I had started therapy but I wasn\\'t at all consistent with it. Not because it wasn\\'t good or because I had something against it, just because depression had sapped all my self motivation to engage with it. I would still interact with friends but it was extremely taxing. It felt inconsiderate to drag anyone else down with me so I would spend a lot of what little energy I had to still interact positively with people around me. Only a few people really ever saw how I was actually feeling behind it all. I\\'m sure my friends loosely pieced together some extent of things but I doubt they had any idea of the full picture. Like knowing I was subtly lower energy or slightly down in mood, but unaware of the depression specifically.\\n Going to sleep eventually only led to dreams where I also felt depressed. Long nights of crying from the emotional pain and frustration of my situation. Constantly asking myself \"*Why do I feel this way\"* and desperately searching for a solution, hurting more and more every time I came up empty handed. Strangely enough, it was never really self-esteem involved which made it all the more confusing to me. I *knew* there were many people that cared for me, that I was intelligent, that I\\'ve had many good experiences in my life, that I had value as a person. And yet none of that mattered to me and only made it that much more frustrating to feel so miserable. There were a couple of months where I hit my personal rock bottom. I had fully disengaged from everything in my life, I couldn\\'t even muster the energy to so much as play a video game. For about two weeks things got exceptionally bad. I was never actively suicidal or thought about self harm, but during those two weeks and maybe some surrounding them I felt to be what I consider passively suicidal. I no longer actually cared to be alive. I hurt all day, and hurt in my dreams. The only relief I had was unconsciousness between REM cycles. I wasn\\'t going to kill myself, but the idea of just falling asleep and not waking back up, or just withering away to nothing, appealed greatly to me (It took me awhile to type that sentence because of all the powerful feelings it brings up even just thinking about it). For those two weeks I did almost absolutely nothing but lay in bed, either staring at the ceiling or trying to sleep. I barely ate or drank at all, some days not eating anything and the others likely less than 500 calories. If my parents came to check on me, I\\'d quickly pull out my phone and make it appear as if I was at least doing something minuscule then immediately putting it away as soon as I was out of their attention. Maybe in some way I really needed to hit this point, as shortly after began the slow climb out of the pit of my depression.\\nI don\\'t know exactly what it was, maybe just absolutely crippling boredom, but one day not long after that two week period I decided to go back and play a videogame I had started but never finished. May also be in part to having decided to be more consistent with taking my prescribed SSRI (which I had not been at that point). To me this was the moment things began to improve, albeit slowly. It wasn\\'t much, but it was infinitely better than passively killing myself. I slowly started to reengage over the next few months with very basic things like videogames and some of the online friends associated with them, with TV shows/movies, streams etc. I still largely felt numb while engaged with these things, none of it felt satisfying or truly enjoyable but it at least distracted me from some of the pain. Soon my younger sister still in high school started having late night practices multiple times a week which I would provide rides for. Because I didn\\'t want to waste the gas to drive home just to drive back down and then back again (10 miles from the house to the school) it was an easy way to work the gym back into my schedule. Soon I was being much more consistent with my therapy sessions and SSRI use. I was engaging more with my friends. As things shifted into the summer I wasn\\'t feeling nearly as low even if I still wasn\\'t experiencing any happiness. I felt stable enough to take an online class to further my already almost finished degree. To me this actually highlighted the current issue I was facing at the time. I was completing everything on time or earlier, getting almost perfect grades, and not feeling exceptionally sad or stressed. However, I was extremely apathetic. An \"A\" on a paper or assignment felt meaningless, zero satisfaction where I felt it could have been an \"F\" for all it mattered to me. This scared me a lot, and I started reading Reddit *a lot* looking for all sorts of different perspectives on life/activities, desperately hoping to find one that appealed to me. And while I learned a lot in general about many different things, the true way out of my depression came from self reflection.\\nAt some point I resigned to my apathy/anhedonia. Never feeling pleasure was a tough pill to swallow but it was considerably better than emotional pain bringing me to tears on a daily basis. Once I accepted it is when things started to drastically change, because I started treating it almost like a super power. I was just so impartial to everything that in the same vein that otherwise enjoyable activities did nothing for me, otherwise boring/tedious/demanding tasks did nothing either as apathetic boredom was the staple of everything I did. So I figured if I can\\'t be happy I could at least be productive. Took a part time job, upped my gym/fitness routine back to normal, started to live with my grandmother whom, at 93, needed constant help around her house and with errands. She was (Passed 3/4 of a year ago now) an incredibly strong woman and one of my biggest role models, and at the same time could be incredibly finicky and stubborn to the point that she would rapidly wear down the patience of her three daughters. I\\'ve always been an extremely patient person and my \"newfound\" apathy made me perfectly suited to help her on a constant basis. At some point I had also stopped taking any SSRIs (without letting anyone know), as they had helped me get out of that extreme low point but now I had my physical energy and all they were doing was giving me restless energy with no impact on my state of mind. Eventually I transitioned from weekly therapy sessions to biweekly. I stopped drinking soda entirely, not that it was really limiting my health, I just figured I got no pleasure from it so now\\'s the best time to drop an unhealthy part of the diet. While I still couldn\\'t feel pleasure and that I was largely just unsatisfyingly going through the motions of life I did feel as though I proved I was stable enough to return for my last semester of college at the start of the next year. My parents and therapist agreed with me, maybe even more so after I revealed to them that I had taken myself off the SSRIs months beforehand and remained increasingly stable.\\nGoing back out to college I had fiercely crafted a productive routine consisting of very little besides classes/studying, exercise, eating, and sleep. About 8hrs of sleep, 5hrs of exercise (Combination of yoga, weight training, swimming, and running), 3hrs of eating (To maintain high enough calories for all the exercise), 6hrs of class/studying, and 2hrs of free time per day (More free time on the weekends). Every day was packed but it was easy to keep moving as long as I stayed moving because there wasn\\'t anything that I actually *wanted* to do that could distract me. I was also going to group therapy twice weekly, and this is something that I think benefited me immensely even now. A lot of CBT along with just being able to talk and share experience with others directly that really aided my ability to feel comfortable with being vulnerable. I became aware that *inactivity* was a trigger for my depressive feelings. Because I was so apathetic, if I \"stopped moving\" there wasn\\'t really any motivation to \"start moving\" so to speak, which made the weekends the more dangerous days of the week. It was also a fine balance of trying to determine whether or not it was physical/mental exhaustion that legitimately required rest, or simply depressive/apathetic thoughts pretending to be the same thing. I had created a mental image of a physics block diagram that had all the factors of my internal motivation and how depression fit into that. Spring break almost caused me to slip out of things entirely due to the sudden week+ long void in my routine, and the after effects were still felt for a few weeks. Luckily the gains in vulnerability paid huge dividends with getting myself back on track successfully.\\nEven more optimistic, I had started to get a number of very brief breakthroughs against the anhedonia. The first one almost brought me to tears. I was finishing my last lap on the track and *really* pushed myself on the last sprint and felt a deep internal focus and drive I hadn\\'t felt felt for a long time. I wasn\\'t just pushing myself to be productive, I was pushing myself because I *wanted it.* I probably would have broke down and cried on the spot but I fought back the tears because I was still at the gym. The second time was during a night run and as I came up over a hill I looked over the town lights from above and at the big starry sky and felt the cool air and just had the brief feeling of legitimate happiness. Something I hadn\\'t experienced in over two years by that point. Because I was all alone I didn\\'t even fight the tears this time around and just let them flow as I continued my run. Another time was when I had just got done with my evening yoga and was on the way back to my place listening to some comedy online radio station. It was just some dumb joke but I actually laughed out loud at it, which stopped me in my tracks because I realized I actually *enjoyed* it. Each of these little moments were fleeting, only maybe a couple seconds, but they were so incredibly powerful to me. They are still incredibly powerful to me, I was in tears yet again just typing them out here. It truly put things into perspective for me of just how starved for happiness I was, and I clung to those tiny moments intensely.\\nThe next and maybe biggest challenge was still just down the road. While I finished the semester with a strong GPA and walked at commencement, I still had to take a summer field course. This meant no access to group therapy. Camping out in remote locations working on stressful assignments with little in the way of all they typical comforts from home. This would last for nearly two months. I won\\'t lie, it did make me quite anxious. It was testing a lot of skills I had learned prior to my two year break from school and it was a sharp change to go from two group therapy sessions a week to none while removing comfort and increasing stress. And really it turned out to be just what I needed. About 2-3 weeks in I was starting to regularly experience freedom from my depression. Much longer lasting moments of happiness as a more frequent occurrence. Anxiety driven by Imposter Syndrome subsiding as I started doing exceptionally well on each project. Not that my emotional well being wasn\\'t being tested. There were nights in my tent that I had felt very low and resulted in crying. My grandmother that meant so much to me passed away three weeks into it (I still got to talk to her on the phone that same day). And even though these challenges came at me it was just more and more proof that I could process them effectively and not get caught in a downward spiral. I finished with straight A\\'s across each section and felt *satisfaction* finally. I knew somewhere in the field course experience the grip of depression had finally loosened and I felt I was starting to get some space to live.\\nFlash forward to now and I feel as though that grip is gone almost entirely, save for in my memories. It\\'s tough to say when I actually felt totally over it. Not quite right at the end of the field course but also before the last few months where my life has actually been going exceedingly well. I do know that it will always be a part of me, an incredibly important part of me at that. It\\'s something I think about quite often, and doing so typically brings tears quite easily. But they aren\\'t tears of sadness or feeling weak, rather tears of knowing the strength that I had to fight a war with such an insidious opponent and come out victorious. I even sometimes think now that I\\'m grateful for it all in retrospect, as I am so much stronger of a person because of it. That if I had the opportunity to go back to the start and magically prevent the depression from ever occurring in the first place, I wouldn\\'t. I know my situation was considerably less severe than that of many others out there. People driven to self harm or suicidal thoughts, depression that has lasted much longer and/or that has been coupled other terrible things like abuse/anxiety/bipolar/etc. But I do think that regardless of when you find your way out of it all (And you will), eventually you\\'ll look back at it with a strange fondness for all of the strength and growth it gave you. How positively it shaped you in the long haul, even if positivity is a far off concept for you now like it was for me. To maybe help some people along this path I\\'d like to share some things that worked really well for me and hopefully they can for you too:\\n* **Please, please, please, get help!** This is not a battle you want to be fighting by yourself. I assure you that there are so many people that want to see you get better and help you in doing so. Many can be complete strangers. For me it was my direct family, my grandmother, my friends (Even if they didn\\'t know the extent of things), my therapist/counselors, and so many random people on Reddit I never even directly interacted with gave me crucial perspective on life when I needed it most. Speaking of, I would feel more than happy to be one of those people to help anyone struggling so don\\'t hesitate to message me if you want to talk.\\n* **Vulnerability.** This goes hand in hand with getting help. You are **NOT** weak for being vulnerable. You are **NOT** weak for seeking help. Vulnerability is one of if not *the* greatest strength I have taken away from my experience with depression and what has helped me the most when fighting back against it. Just openly talking about my feelings with others in group therapy was liberating, as was openly listening and accepting the vulnerability of others. When I think back to my lowest points I felt so incredibly weak, but when I think about the moments where I vocalized and shared those feelings I feel so strong.\\n* **Therapy**. Undoubtedly what ultimately got me through it all. Both one on one therapy and group therapy worked very well for me. Everyone can be different though. You yourself might respond better to one type or the other, with one style of therapist or another, with a certain personality of the therapist, with a certain frequency of visits. It\\'s important to spend the time finding the fit that works the best for you. And this fit can change for you over time. I felt like I had kind of capped out on one-on-one therapy on a biweekly basis after a certain point and switching to group therapy at 4x the frequency benefited me greatly. However I needed that one-on-one time to even get to a point where the group therapy could be beneficial to begin with. For you it might be the opposite, or it might just be wildly different. Whatever you feel comfortable with and works.\\n* **Medication.** The idea of being put on an SSRI was terrifying to me in a lot of ways. It crystallized the severity of my situation and the idea of taking drugs to intentional alter my mind was not appealing to me. I had an off and on relationship with my consistency taking them. It was definitely necessary to get out of the lower depths of my depression. And as my depression evolved so did my medication needs. If I was more consistent with my medication it might have sped along my journey. While going off of them towards the end was ultimately the right call it was admittedly quite risky to do that without consultation first and I would not recommend my behavior in that case. Like therapy, it is very important to find that \"right fit\" of medication, whether it is none at all or some developed combination of SSRIs you and you psychiatrist have determined over time.\\n* **Engagement.** As depressive thoughts would take hold of me I would disengage more and more from different things in my life. It always felt easy, even like the right thing to do, under the excuse of \"just being tired.\" In reality it was the opposite, I wasn\\'t *truly* tired, and the more I disengaged the easier it was to get pulled by depression. It was slowly reengaging with things, even if the happiness was gone from them or diminished greatly, that triggered my recovery and eventually led to moments of lucidity long term. That\\'s not to say you should just jump back to everything in your life all at once. I know that would have overwhelmed me and cause more of a backslide. Just a gradual reintroduction of things you used to enjoy and maybe some new things you\\'ve found along the way. Maybe a simple routine and some light responsibility that you can steadily add to as you feel comfortable. Things to keep you moving and not trapped in place where depression wants you.\\n* **Positive Reframing.** If I had to mark the point where I really started to fight back against depression it would be when I reframed how I thought about my anhedonia. I found the silver lining to what otherwise felt like an incredibly hopeless situation. Making peace with potentially never being able to obtain happiness again so I could then focus on at least being productive. Like I mentioned before, I became mindful of it almost as a super power. I couldn\\'t do anything to make myself happy so I no longer concerned myself with that. On the flipside I could do incredibly boring but highly productive things seemingly endlessly and not feel any different than doing something I would have otherwise enjoyed. My happiness was no longer in my direct control so I put my attention on what was, and that was productivity. \\n* **Smiling.** This last one might sound a little weird, but sometimes its the small and odd things like this that can really help someone. I was doing a lot of outside work during cold winter months and was frequently wearing a facemask. At some point I started just putting an almost loony smile on my face underneath as I worked without fear of looking like a weirdo and without actually feeling happy either. Overtime it did feel as though just doing that would lead to small upticks in mood. Nowhere near happy but it added to the slowly building positive buffer keeping me from sinking back down.\\nSo that\\'s my story when it comes to my depression, from start to end. Doing this has been something I had meant to do for awhile now, as far back as when I was only starting to truly overcome it. Some of the most beneficial things to me during that dark time was reading different perspectives of people whom had faced their depression and come out the other side for the better so it only feels right that I pay it forward now. Anything I\\'ve spent thinking about writing this, actually writing this, and shedding tears on this would be immediately worth it if only a single person finds something even marginally useful out of it all. Don\\'t hesitate to comment on this or message me directly if you want to talk. Discussing depression is never going to be a burden to me because I choose not to let it be so. I also encourage others like me, whom have made it out of the tunnel, to share your own experience.

Might go out on my own terms. Depression has destroyed my mental state. I don’t see myself recovering from it ever. Lost so many friends, depended on people too much. Maybe, I was the problem in my last relationship with her. Maybe she didn’t do anything wrong. Was I too dependent on her? Did I try too much? Was I obsessive? I don’t know anymore. Maybe I’ll never find out. “I love you so much. I don’t want anyone else”. “Nooo Joel, I won’t get with someone else in chaing Mai. I love you, and only you”. Hopefully the mental pain stops soon.

I’m honestly a pretty young person, just turning 20 a few months ago, and I cannot see myself getting to age 40 at all, hardly even to 30.

I don’t even really know what my best life is either, I hardly have any will to do pretty much anything now, and anytime I attempt to do something I want to try, I mess it up and feel worse than if I did nothing at all.  \\nI don’t even feel any fear about dying, the only things I’m scared of are the possible pain, and being sad about the small amount of people who care about me. Which I find pretty stupid since why do I care, I’ll be dead anyways. But I do and the pain and few people I have are pretty much the sole reason for me to stay alive, which I hate since that’s a terrible thing to do to someone. I can’t just hold onto people who care about me to keep me alive for my entire life. Because they won’t be here forever, especially with the way I treat them by being like this. And at the rate that I’m going, I’m not even sure if I’ll fear the pain anymore with how bad I feel, there comes a point where the mental pain is bad enough to outweigh any physical pain. I’m even kind of getting there now, I don’t really get VERY sick, but any time I do get sick I highly prefer that to any of the mental things I go though.  \\nI started a medication a few weeks ago, and I’m not sure if it’s just because I can’t handle things well and haven’t had to deal with real side effects in my life so far, but it went **bad** for me. I was pretty tired the morning I took it since I was up all night, after sleeping the day before, so I fell asleep about an hour after I took it. But 3 hours later I woke up in my bed, feeling extremely dizzy just lying down, then I got up and rushed to the bathroom and puked, and I never puke. (The last time I did was probably 5 years ago when I made the mistake of choosing to sit up when I had blood drawn, making me lightheaded and eventually throw up.) And through the rest of the day it was a little difficult to breathe for nearly the entire day, yawning making me unable to breathe at all for around a second, deep breaths too. My face, hands, and feet got very pale during the first few hours after I woke up too, along with random sweating at times. A few other regular physical side effects, and that was that entire day. But still that day I would rate as infinitely better than any of my bad depression days, some days I even have the urge to take one again just for the hell of it. And after that experience, I think that I’m completely done with these medications for depression. This is the third I’ve taken and after 2 previous ones which did absolutely nothing for me, neither regular effects nor side effects, then this, I’m done with them.  \\nI feel like therapy and counselling also can’t help me at all, I’m just not in a mental position for it to do anything of meaning at all. I need things to actually happen, not to sit in a room with someone I don’t even know while they tell me things to do which I don’t feel a will to do at all. I’d need something big to happen to shock me out of this hole I’m in, give me any sort of reason to go on with things. And the weird thing is is I’m not all doom and gloom about everything, I’m not some, “nothing matters, what’s the point of anything, everything’s going to go away anyways” I’m just like, “Okay, and?” about that kind of stuff, I feel no dread or hopelessness about it. I’m a weird person with that, it’s like I’m almost at the point of being content in life, yet at the same time I’m almost at the point of ending everything due to how terrible I feel.\\nSchool for me was pretty much terrible, I don’t remember much about the first few years, but up until around grade 4 I had a few people you could kind of call friends, but even by that point the amount was dwindling. Then I changed schools in grade 5 because we moved, and I did not make a single friend at that school, I hadn’t at my old one since grade 2 either. I did have a neighbour whose house I went to a lot, but honestly, it was all to play games at his house since all we had was a PS2 with a couple games and an N64 with a few games, with a crap computer and absolutely terrible internet. Meanwhile he had a PS3, and a computer that could run games I couldn’t imagine my computer running, so of course I went over there to play games. At school I would spend recess literally just standing or sitting at a wall because I didn’t have a single person I could even call an acquaintance. It got to a point where in grade 7 the teacher told me I could just stay inside for recess, and in grade 8 too after a few weeks. Grade 8 I would probably say is the last good year of my life, I was still very sad a lot of the time, but compared to now I was the cheeriest person on the planet. High school is when shit really hit the fan for me though, I never showed up, I probably missed around a fifth of the days, I missed many many days in school before that, it kept getting progressively worse since grade 4. Grade 9 was probably the weirdest year there, I got much worse than how I was the previous year but I wasn’t anywhere as near as bad as after that. But after 9 things went downhill real fast, grade 10 I failed nearly half of my classes, but due to the way high schools work here I went on to grade 11, but I needed to get those grade 10 credits before I could graduate, and grade 11 I failed *every single class I took* there was not a single credit I gained that year, then I went on to grade 12, which I hardly even had any grade 12 classes for, then I went back for another year, and another year. And by that point I was 18, so I didn’t need to even get all of those credits anymore, all I needed was 7 specific ones from grade 12 to graduate, so I haven’t even properly completed high school like the regular kids. The school never punished me for missing as much as I did either, which certainly set me up for failure with how I view working in my life.\\nAnd I get that I’m just a whiny baby but I cannot think of a single job that I would do and not feel terrible doing. I hear people say, “but when you start making money that’ll get you to do it, so you can do the things you want to do.” but I don’t want to do anything. Having a job to make money would do what? Even if I had something I wanted to do, the amount of stress I’d feel every day from it, making me depressed and anxious constantly would put me in no position to want to do them. And I can’t just “get a job in something I like”, I’m hardly interested in anything in the first place and if I did any of them as an actual job I would almost instantly start to despise it because adding the needs of a job to something I like would make it like anything else. All this makes me feel even worse because what gives me the right to feel like this over something as simple as a job, nearly every single other person has to deal with this shit and just does it, even if it stresses them out they trudge on with it and just do it. But here I am sitting on my ass feeling bad because what, life is stressful? Tough shit, it is for everyone else too, why should I feel like this.\\nNot to mention that I’m trans, even if I sorted every single other thing in my life out, there’s that too, and there’s nothing you can do to get rid of that. And maybe I could have not been if my childhood had been different. I also grew up mostly without a dad, he was in my life for the first few years, but not long enough to form memories, then he came back for around 2 years, but one day just left out of the blue, not a single person knew where he went. So all I’ve had around for most of my life was my mom, she didn’t get with any other guy either so it was just her, me and my brother, who I have a pretty tenuous relationship with. I’d say after my dad left we were solidly lower-middle class, things were pretty hard since my mom got laid-off her job after 20 years when the place closed down, which was not long before he left us. Around age 5, (my dad was gone at that time) my mom dropped me off with someone to babysit me, I remember her being around her late teens or something, I don’t remember much because I was 5. But I do remember that she made me finger her, you know. Even now in text it’s hard for me to say it. But that moment is the most clear memory of my life, especially that far back, I remember the room, what she was wearing, and how confused, weird and awkward I felt from it. When my mom came to pick me up from there I told her and she went livid, rightfully so. I haven’t told her I remember so I think she might just think I forgot about it, but I certainly have not. My mom was also so giving to me too, but I wouldn’t say overprotective because she never kept me from doing things, she just let me do whatever, even when doing whatever was the last thing I needed. You need to discipline your kids, not too much but you need to. I only remember being spanked a few times in my childhood, I don’t even remember what for, my mom once did the classic soap in mouth for swearing, and that got me to never swear in my life until age 11, not so much as a shit or ass left my mouth. But that’s it, I never had chores as a kid, I never had an enforced sleep time, though I did often sleep at the right time at a younger age, but the older I got the later I stayed awake. She never grounded me, never took away anything when I misbehaved, she let me just eat whatever I wanted, which led to me getting very overweight, I’ve gotten less so but, I still am. At this point it’s nothing to do with her anymore, I’m an adult I should get my own shit in check but I just don’t. I get why did this though, it’s just her, since the man she was with for over 20 years and had 2 kids with left without a word, not wanting to be bad to your kids. But there is a difference from treating your kids badly and giving them discipline and teaching them manners.\\nI often wonder if it’s because of all these things that I am trans, maybe I had a certain predisposition to being this way, then with a mom who gave too much, no dad, and being technically molested at around 5 years old, that it made me this way.\\nI feel like my childhood was average, or even better than most in this part of the world, but then I think about how things were, and think, \"well pretty sure that\\'s not a normal thing\" yet I still continue to tell myself it was since my mom was nice to me, probably too much.\\nThis is probably entirely word vomit and I don’t know if I made much sense here, just jumping all over the place, but just need to vent this somewhere, I already make my friends deal with me enough to drop more conversations like this on them.

I had my friends and I was never bullied or anything...\\nMy junior/senior year of high school, things started to get a little weird. My friends were still loyal, but I would just catch weird, hateful glances from girls I didn’t even know.\\nIn pretty much every work environment, I was just hated. It was always women who hated me, but- \\nPeople say that women are more sensitive and relational or whatever. That aspergers is like, a “male” brain?\\nI took an AP Statistics class my junior year of high school, and as a project I actually compared index:ring finger ratios to behavior. So if you haven’t heard about this, if you have a longer index finger it’s a sign of being exposed to more estrogen in the womb, a longer ring finger is indicative of more testosterone \\nAnd interestingly it correlates with spatial vs verbal reasoning. And actually “verbal reasoning” encompasses algebra interestingly. People with comparatively long index fingers scored higher on algebraic tests, people with longer ring fingers did better on spatial \\nANYWAY I have a long index finger and do terribly spatially. So I’m really not very “male-typical”. I actually could have told you that; I’m not competitive or aggressive at all either.\\nSo anyway- \\nI don’t think my problem is that I’m not “female” enough, but for some reason I just keep getting these girls that fucking hate me and I don’t ever know what I did to deserve it. \\nI wonder if you can have a very “female” brain but still have aspergers?

I was raised with the idea that doing something \"for attention\" was something to be frowned upon. Despite this however I was desperate to know that someone was listening, that someone cared. It was at this point that I started talking about suicide as I felt if anyone was listening they would want to know and understand why. I was **wrong**. after discovering how I was talking my aunt proceeded to take me to her house, where she screamed and yelled at me for quite some time about how she was going to \"put the fear of god into me\". It was after this that she decided to get a kitchen knife from the (knife) block, claiming that it would be the easiest way to do it. She then attempted to give me the knife while  saying that I was \"just doing it for attention\" and that if I actually going to do it to do it, as she would sit back and watch. I\\'ll never understand why she felt it necessary to do this to an eleven year old boy.\\nIf you\\'ve gotten this far I\\'d like to thank you for reading my post, I can post about some of the other times if you\\'d like.', 'text_b': None, 'label': 1}, {'guid': 954, 'text_a': \"Has anyone here had their life completely turned around? : I'm currently struggling a ridiculous amount. \\nI was depressed before all of these things started happening, so my depression definitely isn't circumstantial.

All of elementary and middle school i was bullied i was left out or i had no one to talk to. My mother had talked to the school counselor to get me diagnosed with a form of high functioning autism. I was thrown on random meds to the point that i wasn't able to control myself. I looked like a zombie, i acted like a zombie. Growing up i was never allowed to show my true self, i was always scared to be me. My mother and father fought all the time until they split up when I was 10. My mom moved to Raleigh and took my sister and i with her, she could only afford a duplex in the bad part of town, for all of 6th grade i was the only white boy in my school, i had a target on my back i was always getting into fights or altercations it got bad enough that people would come to my house to try and fight me. There were multiple times where I was getting shot at in the neighborhood I lived in. The police would drive by all the time doing patrols or scouting the area before they did a drug bust. i remember one day after school i had gotten off the bus to walk to my house and all i could see were red and blue lights in front of my house as multiple cops had just busted into my home. I had lost it when i saw swat dragging my mom out in cuffs. After my dad heard about that he had my sister and I moved back in with him. When we got off the plane to live with him we met his new girlfriend, instantly I knew she wasn't good. My dad worked hours away from where he lived so there would be times we would be left alone with her for weeks on end, she had all of these strict rules with harsh punishments almost always she would escalate it to the point of myself or my sister getting swatted with a wooden spoon, hanger, belt, and even a 1x4. There were times where she said she wanted to break a piece of oak over my back side, i remember how i spent more time crying myself to sleep then actually being happy, i wasn't allowed to talk to anyone about what was going on and it had gotten so bad on so many occasions that i was actually scared for my life. I didn't know how i was going to be able to go to school the next day, hell i would rather go to school then be home and school wasn't much better for me, i was always alone, i had no friends and i had no one to talk to. I would always have to run out of class crying because something small had happened that would upset me. Growing up i could remember multiple times where i wanted to die, where i thought that was the only way out of the misery i was going though. I had attempted to take my own life on multiple occasions. I had tried 2 times before i was 10, once i tried to overdose, again i had used a string as a noose. When i was 17 i tried again but this time i had a gun to my head. I had almost fully depressed the trigger but something stopped me. I can't explain the feeling but my body almost felt as though i was overtaken by an outside force. There's times I sit there and wish that I had pulled the trigger, times I wish I wasn't alive anymore, when I was in the school house I had gotten so overwhelmed that I had to leave my room. It was a wednesday evening around 11 or 12pm, the duty nco was doing his rounds checking the building. He saw me sitting on the stairs and instantly knew something was wrong, he said the last time he saw someone with the expression i had on my face they had killed themselves. Growing up I was always down and sad. It takes me a minute to think of something that made me smile, it's not hard for me to think of something negative that happened when i was growing up since that's 90% of what happened when i grew up. Hell there's multiple times where my step mother had called the cops on me because she didn't want to “deal” with me. No matter what happened I would get punished, my sister ran away from home and I was the one who suffered the consequences because I didn't stop her. I would always cry myself to sleep if i could fall asleep. Now every time someone raises a hand at me I flinch, not because I'm scared but out of reflex. Id always feel more comfortable away from everyone being alone because i was scared i'd do something to get in trouble. I never went out growing up and i didnt have any friends I was close to. I still have problems talking to people. I have problems telling people how i feel or expressing my emotions. I remember after my stepmother had called the cops on me and when i was back home from the hospital she had me sit down at the dining room table every day from sun up to sun down writing 4 sentences over and over again. Every day after school i would have to sit there and do homework. After I finish my homework I'd have to start writing. I ended up writing all 4 sentences 1000 times each. The only way I was allowed to move was to ask if i could use the bathroom. On the weekends she'd make me get up at 7 to sit down there and start writing. And i'd sit there up to 10pm. And every time I tried to talk to someone about it she'd either deny it all together or she'd say that I was overreacting. I was all the time getting screamed at, cussed at and belittled saying i would never be good enough, id never do anything with my life or id never do anything to matter. That i would end up being some low life piece of trash. I spent more time in my room away from everyone then trying to socialize because i was scared of human interaction. I didn't tell my dad about my first girlfriend until after we broke up because i was scared that he would disown me. I never had someone i could go to to talk about things with. I wasn't allowed to go out, I wasn't allowed to socialize, I wasn't allowed to express myself. I'm almost 20 years old and i still don't have a good social life. I moved out at 1 years old.

And then I came home and realised that I was scared to feel really down again and did everything I could to prolong my happiness.

One thing that made me doubt it was when a meme was shared on our group chat. It was something like ‘5 types of friends’ and  the depressed one came up. We were all making jokes about it, me included, and deciding who was who. One of my friends said that I definitely couldn’t be the depressed one, along with her and another. That had me thinking, first : damn, I’m a good actor. Then: none of them really know. If I killed myself, it would be a massive surprise. I don’t know if I could do that to them. Since then, I’ve tried to leave a couple of hints but they weren’t really good hints and weren’t picked up. That sucked. I want them to know it wasn’t their fault but I don’t want to leave a suicide note. I would be expected to explain my actions and if I survive, it would make my life a living hell. \\nI also have one friend, who could be extra vulnerable or saddened by my sudden death. She has admitted to every one that she has struggled with depression and suicidal thoughts but isn’t diagnosed because her family don’t have enough money for a psychiatrist. I’m kinda jealous that she was able to confess everything to this group of people she wasn’t super close with. I can’t even confess to my sister and I’ve know her my whole life. The confession seemed sincere and I had noticed she was a bit distant some days. So it is believable. And I don’t want her to do the same thing. \\nI also don’t know how. An overdose on pills probably won’t kill me and I don’t go outside much so I don’t have many ideas for a bridge to jump off. I always have the urge to kill myself whenever something slightly wrong happens. Like saying something weird or embarrassing at the time or doing something stupid. That’s why I tend to make a lot of jokes and surreal crap, I don’t focus on it because it makes literally no sense and other people found it funny too. \\nI’m tired of this and it’s 1am now.

I loved Emily so much that I couldnt stand hurting her, so I started to hurt myself. This is when I stared to cut my arms. She noticed my arms and of course seeing that made her even more upset.

I didn\\'t hear from her a day or two after that night. But that night I had a lot of blood dripping out of me and i cried myself to sleep most nights after. Emily was ok and nothing serious happend to her thankfully.

I’m the stubborn kind, specially when it comes to issues concerning myself or people that I love - I seem to always think I know exactly what’s wrong and how it can be fixed. So much so that a week ago I decided it was better to go to the ER to get a very minor symptom checked rather than waiting to go to my family doctor the next day. I went to them three times the same week because I was worried about my fucking bowel movements .. so unaware of my tendency to project my mental struggles on my body.  \\nThe funny thing about all of this is that if someone had pointed that out to me I would’ve denied it without a second thought, not wanting to believe that I like to concoct scenarios that stray my own attention away from my real struggles. \\nSo that’s why I decided to write. To gain some clarity for myself for once. No bullshit, just unfiltered thoughts pouring out of me.. \\nand halfway through was when it clicked for me.\\nThe times my parents had tried to get me out of bed, to get me up for school, or the texts I’d receive throughout the day from my closest friends asking where I was and why I wasn’t there.. it became clear that they all knew way before me how horribly depressed I was. I wasn’t fooling anyone except myself.\\nI couldn’t get help because I didn’t know how to admit to myself how badly I wanted to mute the thoughts in my head. How I didn’t know how to trust myself or my opinions, my values, my emotions. So many times id rather not feel anything than to feel something because I thought my emotions were so invalid, minuscule and unimportant . \\nAnd I was so sure everyone felt the same way.\\nIt’s crazy to think how many people I’d use as anchors to enable these shitty views of myself and my self esteem. I liked to focus on other people because that way I could ignore my own inability to express what I felt and how I dealt with myself.. which was doing absolutely nothing. I’d do nothing for my own good.. I’d do it for the sake of my parents or my friends or my growing hunger for stability. It was always a race to see how far I would make it before collapsing into my bed for three days straight with my lights off and often a show in front of me or a book in my hand , telling myself I’d deserved the break because I’d exhausted myself the week before it - and that was true. My highs are always filled with days of me spending time outside and with my friends. School and work and parties and hangouts .. anything that would stop me from going home. That’s what I love, and also what I hate when I crash. Because that’s when I overthink every detail of my life. From my acne prone skin to my too skinny face or my slanted nose, how’d I’d looked in a picture or how I’d reacted to a situation . All running through my head at a speed that would be exhausting , so I’d rather turn it off by focusing on something or someone else , fictional or non fictional. \\nI guess that’s also when I developed my eating disorder. When I would refuse to eat even a bite, lay in bed and starve because I’d eaten “too much” the past week. I’d spent my meal points for the week so I had to make up for it somehow, right? How else could I keep the only redeeming quality about myself? How else could I justify the amount of times I’d kneeled on the washroom floor to hurl after a night out? All that work couldn’t go to waste of course. \\nI was so blind to it all. I used to think I had a “digestion problem” and that’s what I would get “nauseous” after every meal.. it was better to relieve it than to deal with the nausea the entire day.. wouldn’t you agree? \\nYet again, I’m sure the only one I was able to keep fooled was myself. \\nI hope my point didn’t get lost in between all my ramblings. this is the real danger of writing purely and without any filters - sometimes you forget what you wanted to get to in the first place. I guess what I want to get at is how so incredibly relieving it became once I saw it for myself. Without the beer goggles on, without the denial clouding my judgement. I needed help. I took a long time to get it because I thought I could work out my “laziness”. But I never did. Not until I got some time for myself without worrying about school or maintaining an A1 social life.

Contrary to my complaints, to my criticisms, the unfair sharpness of my judgements, I’ve always been an optimist. Or perhaps I was just arrogant. I still am.\\nIt shows in my recklessness, my impulsiveness. In nights not spent studying and a wandering mind behind the wheel. It speaks of a carelessness that’s selfish and detached and unkind. A non-living thing, upon which life happens and nothing more.\\nOnce, I believed it was simply how I operated. Half-dreaming—or perhaps half-dead— and stolen away by everything and anything that’s simply not *here*. In lieu of eyes, I saw fit to walk through life with my terrible, callow heart. Instead of ears, I feel out the rhythm and the noise, the rise and fall and there I decide. I write and I talk and I think and I answer based on the churning of something inside of me  I cannot clearly name. On the sense of anticipation, such as before a drop or a fall or something equally dire and dramatic, that stays my hand and says *wait*.\\n*Choose another.*\\n*What else?*\\n*Something more.*\\n*That’s not it.*\\n*Start over.*\\nAnd sometimes.\\n*There.*\\nI’ve always trusted it. For everything. Whether it’s deciding on which path to take or what letter to choose, I’ve always relied on this inner knowing that I am nevertheless not privileged to unravel. It might just be what kills me, in the end.\\nBecause with it, I never know when to stop. When to start thinking and not just acting and following and feeling. By blinding myself so willingly, I doom myself to never knowing until long after my foot missed the landing and I fall and fall and fall.\\nIt is arrogance of the highest kind. To trust so completely on the unknown and uncontrolled mechanisms of your own mind that you actually feel surprise when the answer it supplies turns out to be wrong.\\nAnd sometimes, sometimes I use it to pick at reality. *How far can I go before everything collapses? How deep can I twist the knife before my life is irreversibly, horribly destroyed?*\\nThe origins of this strange fixation is long forgotten or simply not made known to me. I don’t know when the longing for the summery start of a hero’s adventure corroded into a morbid fascination for the bitter, winter ending of a villain cut down, left to die alone and forgotten and unforgiven.\\nI cannot help the way my soul quails at the thought of pain, of suffering. But deeper still, I think a large part of me simply knows that I deserve it.\\nIt’s a conundrum, really. It’s difficult to chase that suffering when there’s so many variables at play. Far too many people who have made the poor choice of getting attached, of investing their time in something that’s always waiting to be destroyed. The trappings of family and friends and innocent hearts too quickly broken.\\nPerhaps if I had been born in a different context, I could have done it easily. Took the blade or stole the gun or locked the rooftop door behind me. It’s simple to imagine, simpler still to actually follow through. There would’ve been no regrets, I don’t think, but how could I know?\\nEverything would have lined up so easily. I was already born to kill myself; I just need the right incentive. And yet, time and time again, something holds me back. Such a terrible thing, conscience, how it keeps me caged and wanting. I’m a man on borrowed time, when is it going to run out?\\nMaybe I was never meant to survive my birth. The privilege certainly belongs to greater men and women than I—my brother and my sisters, for one. Perhaps they would have loved being alive. Loved it better, stronger, far less selfishly.\\nAngel. *Messenger of God.*\\nMary Grace. *Beloved; to thank.*\\nBryan. *Noble.*\\nPerhaps they would’ve cherished it, their names, and not grow to hate it—and the ones who gave it to me, just a little—like I have. Perhaps they would’ve been happy and sometimes I think that I’m simply the result of their frustration from never really having the chance to live. After having fought so hard to exist, mine seems like a bitter sigh mistakenly given form after they have finally given up; there’s enough spite, I believe, to justify it.\\nIf they’re with me, I’d like to say that I admire their efforts to remain. The first few years of my life were naive yet blissfuly full of wonder and hope. Far too many for a single child, sometimes, but maybe I wasn’t. I just wish they experienced their lost childhood in a better way, for far longer, before I inevitably destroyed even that.\\nLight may filter down onto shadows but definition demands that only one of them exists in a single space at a time. Where there is light, there is no darkness; where there is darkness, there is no light. Similarly, though they may occupy me for a time, it’s obvious that their hold is not everlasting. I exist too.\\nI miss their presence. They could’ve been happy and by extension, maybe I could’ve taken a little of that happiness for myself. Stored it away, deep down, for when it needs to be there before possibility becomes *it is done*.\\nI do wish to be happy, though I’m slowly realising that it’s less about opportunity and more about capacity. Maybe it’s my fault, maybe it isn’t. But then I never really do anything about it so maybe it is, after all.\\nOur counsellor said that I should stop thinking about it. Would you believe that it actually works? Of course, it does sear a little deeper, a little more violently each time but it does remove its immediate presence.

I want to try and sum up in a few paragraphs what depression means to me and how I’ve learned to deal with it and understand it. \\nIf the cause of our depression is out of our control, we have to try and acknowledge the fact that life will throw us curve balls, takes the wind out our sails and pull the rug from under our feet when we least expect it. It’s not about what happens to us it’s about how we deal with it that matters.\\nMy depression has been caused not by uncontrollable life events, but by my own stupidity, my own poor decisions, my own silly behaviour, my own horrific mistakes. My sadness was caused by nothing but myself. This is a much more bitter pill to swallow but can still be fixed over time. \\nHowever our depression came about, it is our brain that is overwhelmed by negative thoughts. Be it anger or self hate, suicide or self harm, past distresses or consequences. Negative thoughts are playing on a loop in our brain, the longer we allow the negative thoughts to continue the harder it will be to emerge from our depression. \\nI know, trying to tell a person with depression to think positively sounds like a load of bullshit right? But introducing positivity is the only thing that will work. We have to try and see a positive way forward, where we exercise and eat nutritious food. Where we hang out and laugh with friends. Where we start to love and care for the people around us or picture ourselves with a new partner and finally move on from that emotional break up. \\nFor me, when I’m at my lowest I would lose my appetite and wouldn’t go to the gym. I would lose muscle mass and start to look skinny. When I did eat it was just junk food to make the hunger go away. My sleeping pattern was lost and I had dark circles under my eyes. I stopped cleaning my house and allowed it to get messy and unhygienic. I stopped seeing friends and family and cancelled plans because I looked horrific. My job suffered and my finances took a hit. \\nNo matter how bad things appear we should try to remain positive in the important areas of our life. Depression will come and go but our health and hygiene can deteriorate quick when we don’t look after ourselves. Building up from rock bottom each time is difficult, try to avoid hitting rock bottom by staying positive enough to look after ourselves well. \\nLaying in a dark room and obsessing over events that happened last week, last month or last year will get us nowhere, a nutritious meal and phone call to a friend will get us somewhere.

All he wanted was to be happy, but it seems that was too much to ask. I have lowered it to just being calm, to be in peace. But again, I ask too much. I have no reason to continue, and I will not live because others want me to. If I live it is because I want to, I will not depend on another person. I have tried and tried to exhaustion. I\\'ve been holding on all my life. People believe that people with depression or who end their lives do not ask for help. Lie. For four years I have been surrounded by people to whom I tell my problems. Social services, psychologists, psychiatrists, my tutor, the institute\\'s educational psychologist. Four years. If in four years a solution has not been found, it is that there is not. And I don\\'t say it, they say it. His \"solution\" is to hold on. They want me to hold on for two more years like this, and then, after two years, i have to continue hold on, and work hard. And for what? I never asked to be born, I did not ask to come into this world, much less suffer all that I have suffered. Sometimes there is no solution. All you can do is hold on, but you know what? I\\'m human, and I have a fucking limit. They want me to live independently of everything I have suffered and I have to continue suffering, isn\\'t that more selfish than taking my life?

I\\'ve already heard all kinds of messages of support, all kinds of criticism. Neither thing works. There comes a point of no return, and I have already reached it. I spend my days sleeping and distracting myself so as not to think, only for another day to pass. And for what? I know that there are good people, and that there are good things, but they are not worth it. People try not to see reality, because reality is bullshit. It is full of bad people, who screw life to the others. And are we sick? It is easier to convince a person with depression that their thoughts are wrong, that they are wrong because of their illness, that life is really worth it, that things will be solved and that a better future awaits them. That is easier than trying to educate people from a young age, and easier than trying to change bad people. Really, I can\\'t take it anymore, I go on the internet and I get sick, reading comments on Youtube, or on Instagram, or some articles. I get sick, and I can\\'t forget everything I read and everything I see. I know there are people more screwed up than me, who have less than me, who \"complain\" less than me, and still get ahead, or keep trying. I know.

I honestly do not know what I want you to say, because really nothing you say will solve my life or how I feel, nor will it give me hope of continuing to endure or live.

Why haven't I killed myself already? Is anybody gonna read this post anyway? : So many questions, yeah. I think it'd be good to answer them in the order in which they are written. To introduce myself. Hi, my name is Anne and I kinda do like blueberries but that's not the point of this post, so let's get straight to the point.\\nWhat is the **point** of still living (see, I told you we would get to the point)? Many people I know have their future already planned. Which is the best thing that could happen to a person really. You just wanna know where you're going in life. What you wanna achieve. Which job you would like to do one day. Like, everyone of my friends has seemed to know these kinds of stuff for such a long time that it's kinda making me even more depressed. You see, I'm not 18 anymore. I'm turning 25 this summer. This fact is totally crazy cause I'm just way too old for someone that has been wishing to kill herself for such a long time lol.\\nWhich brings me to the second question: Why haven't I killed myself already? Great question, really. The thought of killing myself has been in my mind for quite a while actually. Ever since I got bullied during the elementary schoo, I wouldn’t make a day without thinking how liberating and relieving that act would had been. My life was so shitty at that time that the thought of killing myself one day to end the suffering became the only solution that felt right.\\nThis whole situation became so bad that I started seeing a therapist. Which, at this point, I’m quite thankful for cause if it hadn’t been for him and the pills he had prescribed to me, I wouldn’t have even made it to the end of high school. I was sooo determined to kill myself really, the suffering was just unbearable. Yet, I didn’t do it in the end. But we’re about to get to that later.\\nAnd, I mean, I am the one to blame partly. I have a really unstable personality and it surely is really hard to love me or be my friend. I generally am really kind to people and let them do any bad thing to me if that means they'll still be by my side. It is terrible doing so, I am quite aware of that. But I am often feeling really lonely because of my shyness and social anxiety, so when I start trusting someone, I really am afraid of losing them cause I know I ain’t gonna replace them that easily. \\nLike I said, I am hard to love. I don’t think I’m worth anything to be honest, so I’m always really surprised when anyone actually approaches me and seems to like me. My therapist would have been so upset if he heard me say stuff like that but that’s just how it is. I stopped seeing him quite a while ago when I thought I’m over all this and don’t need him anymore btw. But I guess that I was wrong.\\nOne day, I feel amazing and really happy about my life just to get all depressed and sad the other day (or even the same day, only a couple of hours later lol). I just let myself be hurt by people. Over and over again. Cause it's my fault. On one hand, I know it’s wrong but I just continue letting them do that. I just let my boyfriend treat me like shit sometimes. Cause it's my fault. Plus, who else is gonna love me if he leaves me, right? I just have to endure that. It hurts. But you wanna know what hurts even more? The fact that I can do nothing about it.\\nI’m too scared to be lonely. Some days, I feel like my boyfriend genuinely loves me and cares about me and everything in my life is great. Other days, I just feel like shit, starting to think that killing myself is not that bad of an option after all. It is a great option indeed, yet there’s a tiny little problem. I’m way too scared to do that. If only I had no self-preservation instinct. That shit always stands in my way. It always  felt so right to kill myself but my self-preservation instinct always stood in my way. I am just way too weak.\\nSo here I am. With no future ahead, having to be quarantined because of the corona virus pandemic, which makes my depression ten times worse. I don’t know how long it’s gonna take before I can at least leave my house, but one thing’s for sure. I feel like there’s no future for me and I see dying soon as the only option again. But I'm scared to do that. Again. \\nI am pretty sure that I'm gonna feel better tomorrow and this won't be that much of a problem anymore, but that is what scares me even more. Thoughts like this are always gonna be somewhere in my head just waiting to fire their shot (this expression is probably not used right, but that doesn't matter cause my whole life is trash). And I'm just too scared of the next time they'll come to haunt me. My life is a fucking rollercoaster and I don't find it funny anymore.\\nIs anybody gonna read this post anyway? **Excelent question**, thanks for asking. I don't know. But I feel better having written this down. I don't know why lol. But I just do. So thank you, reddit.\\nIf you did read it till the end though, please don't judge me. I have done that to myself way too much already. I'm gonna cry myself to sleep. To wake up feeling quite fine.

Additionally, the placement sounds awesome and I literally cannot do another year of education straight after this one, I'd end up just dropping out.\\nI think what is really frustrating to me is that all of the placements have expected us to know several things in a great detail of depth which IMO, we haven't been taught. I have tried to look at this stuff online and in books, and just cannot concentrate on it. I'm too burnt out to read and remember the stuff, plus I find learning from books to be just as bad as lectures. The modules which are meant to be teaching us this stuff have either been on strike or have not covered topics in-depth enough to meet the placement's needs.\\nWe have also had lessons canceled due to strikes for months and now the uni is doing all lessons online due to coronavirus - I don't feel like we have been taught much at all and I know that I'm going to struggle with online teaching more than I do in person.

I for some reason have a huge fear of kids around my age. I almost had a panic attack just for checking out my new college with my mum. I don’t think I’ll ever make it there. I like a lot of stuff that I’m sure no one my age likes and I get angry at my relatives for no reason. \\nI hate being a teen. Why do hormones exist? Why is everything so complicated? Why am I losing my mind? I never used to have to worry about any of this shit as a little kid. I wish I could go back in time and undo whatever the fuck it was that made me this way. I come from a good family, so it’s not family related. Only thing I do is isolate myself from the entire world + my family by just staying in my room playing games and watching videos. I can’t do anything else.\\nThe only thing keeping me alive is my family.

Unfortunately for me every door, every option, every opertunity has been closed off for me since I was born. \\nBefore I say what I came here to ask here\\'s alittle backstory...\\nBackstory - throughout my mom\\'s pregnancy the doctors were absolutely sure I was to be born a healthy baby girl, but somewhere along the line something unexpected happened and I came out not only a boy (according to what I\\'ve been told and what\\'s written on my birth certificate) I was also unfortunate enough to be born with cleft lip, cleft palette, asthma, droopy eyes(don\\'t know if that\\'s the clinical term, but basically up until I was 8 or 10 [can\\'t remember] I was unable to open my eyes all the way), and various other problems. I have always felt like I should not have been born a boy let alone live past 3 weeks (another failed diagnosis, lucky me right?). \\nMy childhood consisted of doing stuff to get attention but really all I wanted was to be liked a very hard thing to do when you are basically physically retarded and cannot talk like everyone else and constantly being reminded how you are such a failer that you couldn\\'t even be born right. Since my conciousness first made its way into this world I have found myself thinking as a girl, along with thinking how much better litterally my life would have been if I managed to get it right. My dad was never in the picture so growing up without a father has been difficult on its own, but of course I was informed my dad had the chance to come to America when I was born because of my condition, but he declined to start a new family and I\\'m sure he had other reasons. My mom always worked all the time so it was pretty much me and my older brother for some time. An older brother that constantly made fun of me along with my mom for how I talked and how I acted. My brother constantly calling me gay, faggot, bitch, you name it he\\'s done it. I\\'m sure he was unaware of how I felt inside but it traumatized me so much I am afraid of being myself. My body is not shaped how normal guy\\'s are either so I have no idea how to take that problem. At school o was labeled the retarded kid no one liked.\\nOnce I turned 11 my mom met a man, let\\'s call him D. D was/is military and I later found out they got married quick (span of a few months) to finance my surgeries because I came from a background of poverty being single parent with 2 kids (later 3). I was always treated like a pet and always had the harshest and most frequent punishments. I was always forced to do everything for everybody else. My brother had to go do something like talk to a neighbor to get the bike fixed, I had to do it, stuff like that. To this day I get asked by family to buy their plane tickets or order them stuff cause they \"don\\'t know how\". I have always been used all my life. I am nothing but a tool. As I patiently waited for the surgeries that I was supposed to get (atleast just the one to fix my nose and make me look somewhat normal) when I was 12, then delayed to 16, then 18, and finally at 19. I received the first surgery and all they did was make my life a living hell. \\nMedical history - The doctor messed up my nose and now theres a glasses size gap on the bridge of my nose, for the tip of it they put cartalage from my side [which they lied to me and took it out of under my right chest] is fat which I didn\\'t even care about having in the first place I just wanted my nose to be straight and deal with the rest later. I was put in a maxillary distractor (fancy name for cage on my head). To move my upper jaw forward so that they can reconstruct the palate (roof of my mouth) and straighten jaw or whatever they were doing I have no clue and it seemed unnessesary to me. It did however improve my speech just a tiny bit. I had to wear this crap o. My head for 4 months. Later I then made my own appointments 2 years later (22) and got a surgery for bonegraft. I am still missing the tooth implant which I cannot afford nor will I ever be able to, and I have to have another surgery on my nose again. I have always suffered from depression because of this but not only because of my unfortunate medical circumstances. (Also I have been getting pains around my abdominal area so either I\\'ve got something going on down there that shouldn\\'t be or when I was born the doctors decided it be best to stick a penis on me and call me a boy).\\nAs for the other reasons why I\\'m highly depressed and on the verge of collapsing. I was forced by my stepdad to go into debt. I wanted to go to college but I wanted to do it like everyone else, a real place surrounded by real people so I can maybe make atleast one friend and not be a total failer. Of course my luck hits home again and he forced me to go to an online college with the promiss of letting me use the money the army provides to him for school use. I agree and then he turns and days \"yea no... Do it yourself\". Landing me 16k debt that I can\\'t pay, 3k I was forced to pay (just to get my diploma) and 3k my mom was forced to pay for me to be able to enroll in classes. Before this though I was planning to join the military to get a one up on life, but apparently not God\\'s plan. Since when I brought up the idea he straight refused. I was not allowed to work or go out, I did not have an allowance or any type of money except money I got for my birthday ($20 every year, ages 18-19-20) and it didn\\'t help that I had no friends up until senior year in highschool (that summer is the only happy memories I have after leaving my home town. He was very controlling that\\'s why I feel I can\\'t do anything without the constant reminder of all the trauma I\\'ve faced.\\nI did however keep the promis I made to myself about joining the military. Unfortunately though I was not let in. After two years of waiting and providing all of the medical paperwork I was finally sent to MEPS for the Marines, finally a chance for me to straighten out my life and man up and get all these rediculous thoughts and feelings out my head. NOPE! Once I get there I take the ASVAP and score on the higher side (I know right smarts actually came in handy I might look like a retard but my mental capacity is on the higher side) scored 80. Go through medical everything good up until the physical, the doctor asks me if I always been tall and skinny (I have a very feminine body besides the lack of breasts and having a penis) I say yes, normal ok cool then I go to the eye exam and they tell me I have astigmatism in my left eye (this I knew it happened when I was about 5 or so, started hallucinating and seeing giant spiders with extream detail) I went to see if I can get this fixed they said and I quote \"the damage to your eye is so savire that we do not have the equipment required to even make a dent of progress, the best solution I can offer is to use the effected eye and hope it gets better over time, sorry but there is nothing we can do for you at this time.\" - Lasik doctor. So dream job at Marines = no go. The MEPS people tell me to try the army cause they accept pretty much anyone. I do and same thing they say I can\\'t join because of my stupid eye, gee thanks God. \\nAt this point I start thinking maybe it\\'s not meant to be and give up. \\nMy job history is halarious, atleast to me. Almost even didn\\'t get hired. First job at age 20, McDonald\\'s. Mom gets a house with my brother who got to live my fantasy of being in the military and travel the world, who then decides to mock me and make my life even worse by deciding he needs a surgery on his penis (he thought it was so curved he can\\'t have sex yet he never tried, now he\\'s depressed and thinks he can never have it and the doctor messed up, doctor also gave him circomsition) this happened during my attempt at joining the Marines. Throughout the course of 6 months he would constantly scream at the top of his lungs and say how God hates him, this is punishment, lash out at me for no reason, and make me feel not only unsafe but want to take my own life even more just to get out of that situation. Once we move into the new house this continues along with me every day for months on end calming him down explaining and telling him to be patient cause it\\'s not gunna heal right away and healing of the body depends on the mind state anyways. Because of the move I am forced to quit my job that I actually enjoyed, to transfer to another McDonald\\'s on the side of town we moved to (two towns down) I work there for 6 months before quitting because of how unfairly I was being treated, everything was my fault, I never did anything right, I was lazy, the works (even though I did mainly everybody\\'s job in the kitchen, everyday I washed the grill swept mopped multiple times a day, I would be on grill then on the table making the burgers, I\\'d go and get the 50 pound boxes from the freezer. You name it I did it.) I eventually quit after 6 months bought a one way ticket to California and said my goodbyes to my brother who called my mom crying saying I left and he tried to stop me... I was sick of his shit. I had shit I was dealing with all my life and now I have to deal with you and your problem too, (excuse the langauge but) fuck outta here with that shit. \\nI have so little control over my own life that I only spent 2 days in California before my mom told the entire family where I was and got my aunt (grandma\\'s sister so technically grandma, who\\'s also a nun) to somehow convince me to go to New York and stay with my uncle. I can\\'t believe I actually fell for their stupid guilt trip but somehow after only 5 days I was off to NYC. I told myself it\\'s probably best since there are lots of opportunities for me to be a musican. Wrong. I was basically plummited into the same exact situation with different people. Greedy money hungry aunt, no jobs, no money, an uncle who works at night sleeps durring the day, wierd daughter that turned into her mother. I had to get outta there it got to the point where she was looking through my stuff while I wasn\\'t there to find proof I could pay her $700 to stay in the shitty, stinky room they kept rabbits in. With a door that locks from the outside and a broken window, very small room at that. After two months of looking for jobs while making music simaltaniously I am being called a liar I good for nothing a lazy bum you name it that\\'s what she labeled me. I manage to get a job at McDonald\\'s again but in NY. I manage to set up the bonegraft appointment and lay on an air mattress for two weeks feeling useless and being called useless. I go back to work and then move into my grandpa\\'s room he was renting. Lucky for me he was on vacation for the next two months. Durring this time when my granpa came back j felt obligated and wanted to help with his bills ultimately giving him what little I had. 4 months pass and after much consideration and mom/brother begging for me to come back I oblige. \\nI then get a job at another McDonald\\'s in the next town over oppisate direction with the help of my old boss. I work there for 6 months before quitting because of the same drama the first time and hearing people continuously talking shit about me making me feel terrible about myself even more and with the emense parinoia I was experiencing due to smoking too much (the parinoia was about how I hid the fact I\\'m not normal and that I wish to be a girl and intricate details of my life).\\nIf you think that\\'s it well your wrong... My aunt comes to the USA on a visa and is put in a shit situation feeling unsafe, according to her. My mom is the only one in the USA she knows, mom folds and buys her a plane ticket to stay here for the time being, money my mom didn\\'t have, which is fine desperate times desperate measures and such. She stays here for an entire month and quickly realises there is nothing here, everything is far and you have to drive everywhere. The time that she was here I could have used to work on my music the 3 hours I was left alone in the house, but no. \\nEverything that she bought or well made me buy she complains and says it\\'s for someone else, complains she didn\\'t buy anything for herself and how she had to use my mom\\'s clothes cause instead of buy things for herself she bought for everyone else supposedly. She then says how she needs a phone and makes me go find one for her. After I go through the trouble of finding and iPhone 7 plus for a crazy deal ($150) which they usually go for 300-350 I go and I borrow money to go get her the phone. She then says oh... I wanted a more modern one....like yours.... I\\'m like ugh ok I reset mine give her it and she then says she will give me the 150 (my phone was iPhone X pristine condition). Months pass I still don\\'t have a job (stopped looking to focus on getting my licence), everybody keeps making excuses not to teach me, and the piece of crap car that my brother was going to pass down to me needs a new battery so I can\\'t use it, and he also decided to retract the offer before I got the chance to use it and is selling it because he doesn\\'t want to pay for it. He is not rich but wealthy $40k in the bank meanwhile I\\'m 30k in debt 12 of which collectors are being sent now. \\nDebt - borrowed money I didn\\'t have to help pay bills to not be called worthless and useless.

Thankfully, this acquaintance I had took time out of his day to make music with me at lunch. It really meant a lot to me. He was the only friend I really had at the time. I had hung out with his friends a couple times before throughout high school, so I started playing video games with some of them.

I had actually gotten up that morning to go and take it (my mom took the car extra early and came back late even though I told her that I needed to be at school). Unfortunately this didnt help the fact that I havent been attending school or doing the hwks and labs. My programming professor understood and gave me the slip to go back to do the labs and hwks that I missed. Though again, yesterday I was told that I'm approaching the deadline for this consideration very close and was suggested to take a medical withdrawal by my professor. This year just isnt my year. I feel withdrawn from everything and just cant bring myself to hold onto the shread of stability. Me missing my classes is also something I told my therapist and psychiatrist about. \\nMy professor wants to hold a meeting with me and my academic advisor to see if there is a way to avoid medical withdrawal and catch up on assignments. I appreciated the consideration until early today, when I realized that I most likely wont be attending lab today either. I cant keep doing this. This is the second time I've taken this class and its gotten admittedly worse. The first time was alright but this time...is terrible. I dont have a support group like last time and I dont have a team. My first time, I was turning in assignments but the lack on my part was not studying for the midterm but I still had a long stride of actually passing then. \\nI have a sibling who faced this problem when she tried attending college. She got depressed, started sleeping in and never leaving for school. I dont know why we cant stay in college and actually graduate but it seems like a curse. \\nIf I leave school, I'm faced with having to leave my school job. If I lose my school job, I wont have any funds. My mother will be leaving me in our hometown and I wont be able to get help from her like I need . I know that if i withdraw, i wont be able to withdraw from one class, I'd have to leave all of them. I didnt have the best if luck from finding work without school ties. So, I'm scared to leave school. I'm diagnosed with depression and GAD. I'd be anxiety ridden and depressed knowing that I'll be holding my grad year back and I wont be able to conjure up funds. \\nI wanted to love school. I know I can love learning but I cant seem to love that or anything else right now. I was supposed to be graduating this year but I souldnt be anyway due to needing more classes to complete. I had planned on passing this semester and taking up extra summer classes go shorten time but ...that's all gone. \\nI dont know what to do. Should I schedule this meeting in hope of finding options where I dont withdraw and end up pissing away at the possible opportunities? Or just withdrawal, be possibly homeless and come back to school when I'm better? Its hard making a living without a college degree and im worried.

This is yet another attempt, let’s see what happens.\\nI’m a 30 year old woman, I work as a photographer for a fashion company with a degree in Graphic Design, volunteer at a cat rescue 2 days a week, and suffer from depression and social/general anxiety disorder.\\nI first realized my teen angst wasn’t just a “phase” sometime in my early 20’s. As a teenager I would do the normal things: drink, do drugs, smoke weed. I would also write a lot but this writing, in hindsight, was some of the deepest cries for help. I’ve since lost that precious notebook, but I did come upon snippets of that “poetry” in my other sketchbooks. The stuff wasn’t anything out of the ordinary - I grew up listening to emo and other such heart wrenching music - and the style was really just lyrics trying to artistically describe the dark cloud that was inside of me every minute of every day. I lost interest in that activity around the age of 20.\\nI was always a shy person. I played with friends during school, but I was never allowed to have anyone over or go to anyone’s house. As a result, I was always found by myself in the yard skipping rope alone. My parents brought me to Canada when I was 9 years old in order to expand my options for education. I was born in Russia where there wasn’t much choice at the time to do anything with your life other than engineering, medicine or teaching. In that aspect, I thank them. I was able to attend an art school in Toronto and attain my Graphic Design degree which my anxious artistic brain appreciates.\\nWhen I arrived in Canada I didn’t speak much English and was in an ESL program. In that first year, 4th grade, I was bullied for not speaking the language. Some girls quickly realized that it would be fun to put rocks (the little pebbles from the playground) down my pants while we had “carpet time” (when all the kids gather around crossed legged on the floor in front of the teacher during a lesson.) They knew I wouldn’t say anything, partly because I couldn’t physically, partly because I couldn’t mentally. Kids would kick my chair constantly as they walked by, someone even throw things at me from the back. I brushed it off, went on with it. I did have two great friends (one of which is still in my life albeit we aren’t close.)\\nThis childish bullying subsided after the first year. I went off to another school in grade 5 after moving buildings with my parents. 6th grade was split. It was yet another school (moving from elementary to middle school) and then half way through 6th grade, after establishing quite a solid group of new friends, I was transferred to a new school after yet another move by my parents. I had to start over with the friend thing and luckily I befriended a girl right away. She was also an outcast, being extremely tiny and skinny for her age and also didn’t fit in with the “cool popular kids.” Here I was laughed and looked down upon for being new, having 1 friend, and being so extremely shy. After a while I became close with another girl, let’s call her Jessica. 7th grade went by bearably with her around, outside minor incidents like having the basketball thrown at my head during recess. I was also developing extremely bad acne, so I was doomed to be the ugly shy girl for the next few years.\\nEnding of 8th grade is where the real trouble started with Jessica. She had an “in” with the cooler kids in the grade and being so attached to her, I got to hang out with the group occasionally. This is where we started “relationships” with two boys. She was with lets call him Andrew and I was with let’s call him Mike. We would hang out after school a lot and one day I brought them all over to my house. Mike took me down to my parent’s cellar at one point and where I thought I would have my first kiss, my hands were forced down onto his penis. I didn’t know how to retaliate so I went with it. Instead of a first kiss, I gave my first hand job. The next time we hung out was at the movies. I was brought to the bathroom for what I thought was a make out session but turned out to be an attempt at a blow job. I can’t remember whether I went through with it, I just remember crying that evening. I soon found out that Andrew and Mike had a bet going of who would get their dick sucked first and Jessica agreed to bring me into the group so they could use me for that bet. These things bled into high school. The rumours started that I was a slut and were reinforced with photos being distributed throughout the school. The photos were of me wearing see through mesh pants in provocative poses that Jessica took of me in her room one night when we were having a fun “fashion” night. She wore them too, although somehow the photos of her never got distributed. \\nFinally a new girl came to the school lets call her Beth and finally things seemed to calm down. We had a great friendship going and were inseparable during high school (to the point where people were calling us lesbians.) I even attended her wedding two years ago, she’s a beautiful human being. I tried my best to have a normal life. I threw myself into art. I would come to school at 7 in the morning so spend time in the photography dark room lab. I got great marks in my classes and my teachers loved me. Of course throughout this time I did the regular teenage girl stuff. I liked boys, I would make out with them. I was already well trained in the hand job department so guys learned to hand me over to their friends once they were done with me. I just did it. It made them happy. And in my mind, that made me good at it. Why not do the thing that I felt I excelled at? Of course none of that behaviour helped the growing rumours. \\nI first tried drugs in 10th grade. Beth and I would skip school, pop ecstasy, spend the day together. This went on for about a year in the 11th grade where my marks drastically plummeted. I’m not sure what the triggering factor for me to stop was, but I managed to graduate high school on the honour roll. At the end of 12th grade I met lets call him Sam. We dated for 2 years, I lost my virginity to him, but I will always remember doubting his intentions. Did he stay with me for the sex? Did he only want me around because I would smoke weed with him? It didn’t matter. I lost romantic interest in him after a year but stayed together despite us fighting because it was comfortable and a habit I just didn’t want to, or couldn’t break.\\nI got into my top school of choice and spent the first year working hard. After my break up with Sam, I met lets call him Dale. It was interesting at first. He would show up at my work almost daily and chat and finally we started going on real dates. He brought me gifts and showered with me with attention. I now realize that it was borderline stalker behaviour. He wouldn’t take no for an answer even if I didn’t really feel like doing anything. The thing with Dale is kind of an on and off ordeal. We were never fully together but would hang out often usually drinking or going on drives. I was starting to get really put off by him, but one night he insisted on hanging out. As you well know by now, I have trouble saying no. So we went to the bar, got a buzz going and then went driving. (I know how shameful it is to drink and I drive. I know first hand because I almost killed my friend during a drunk driving episode. I haven’t done it since and will never do it again.) We were in the car and I was completely insistent that this was a non sexual meet up. But he wouldn’t stop trying to kiss me, to push my hands on to his crotch, then pushing my head down, asking me to just suck it a little. I did it just to make him shut up so I could go home. I haven’t seem him since them. I refused to talk to him and eventually had to block him. To this day he tries to make attempts at communication but nothing dangerous. \\nThe truly destructive behaviour started around 22 when I began to frequent parties. At first it was drinking, and a lot of it. Then I met a 28 year old man lets call him Izack. He was a DJ and very much into the rave party scene. It was with him when I tried coke for the first time at the age of 23 or 24. Lets just call the rest a blur. I would party twice a week, heavily on drugs, go to school completely hung over. Long story short, I just managed to graduate, scraping by with a warning letter and passing marks given to me probably only out of the kindness of my professor’s heart. I loved Izack. He was older, had more experience, best sex I’ve ever had and he made me forget everything and everyone. He lived downtown in an apartment with two other roommates who also loved to party and we all got along quite well. The sanctuary of that apartment was heavenly. I would be able to spend all my time there away from my strict Russian parents. Then Izack started going on the road a lot more due to his DJ career flourishing. When he was away, I would come to his place and clean everything. I bought him a huge new TV for his room. I wanted him to come home to a beautiful place. In my mind that was me saying thank you for letting me stay with him rent free for so many days of the week. \\nAbout a year into our relationship, I went for a gynaecologist check up which was followed by a phone call saying that I have an STD. They told me to get myself and my partner into the office so we could be given medication. It was nothing overly serious, cleared up with a few pills but I had to have a serious conversation with Izack. He swore on his life that he never cheated on me. He begged me to believe him which after hours upon hours of me crying and pleading, I finally did. But I never got over the nagging feeling that something wasn’t right. So after a month of uncertainty, over the phone on my birthday (I remember that day so clearly), I asked him one more time. I’m not sure what made him tell me truth this time around, but yes, of course he slept with someone on tour and yes that is how I contracted the STD.\\nI was a complete and utter wreck for the next few months. The drugs and alcohol increased. I went on Tinder and began my first sex binge. At one point I managed to sleep with 6 different men in one week. All I wanted to do was to forget the hurt and I didn’t know how. Again, all of this is very blurry so I can’t say the exact moment that Izack came back into my life but he did. I remember going to a bar to meet him to get closure, to finally say I forgive him and that I’m moving on. That meeting ended up with me in his apartment and sex. We then got “back together”, continued the destructive behaviour until his next tour where he slept with someone again. I let that one go easily since we never stated that we were officially a couple again. I think this is where I learned how to numb my brain from hurt. I wasn’t mad at him anymore, I just quietly walked away and threw myself into my second huge sex binge on Tinder. After a few months of this, I met a guy lets call him Jon. \\nWe dated for something close to a year. This relationship was also fuelled by alcohol, drugs and parties. But at this point I didn’t want another life. The relationship involved me crying almost every day at work with something abusive he may have said to me that day. For example, he loved to make me feel like an idiot for asking him why it took him hours to answer a text massage. I was told I was crazy on an almost daily basis. I will fast forward to the end, where a girl (who is now a friend) reached out to me saying that she was also dating Jon, for 6 months now. She spotted us at a party kissing, and lost her mind. Apparently she had no knowledge of me for the long while they were together. It turns out, that we weren’t the only ones. I came to the knowledge that he had slept with 8 different people during the span of being with me. This included his upstairs neighbour who I was constantly told not to worry about. \\nI laughed at this. I didn’t cry, I didn’t feel angry, I laughed, pulled out my phone and on to the next Tinder binge I went.\\nIt took me about 6 months to get into my next relationship. This one was with a kind man who would never do a thing to hurt me. It lasted for about 2 years. I met his parents and he met mine. We were talking about marriage and moving in together but it ended up falling apart during our search for an apartment. We just weren’t right for each other.\\nSo this is where I am now. 30 years old, living back with my parents. I have since stopped the partying because that life doesn’t satisfy me anymore and my body can’t handle it. I have been coke free for about a year now mainly because I can’t afford it. But I drink. I drink several times a week because I can’t stand my job. I drink because I feel trapped in my own mind. I drink because of my living situation. I drink because nothing I do excites me. I drink about 3 times a week and once I crack a bottle of wine, there is no way I can stop. That bottle is getting drunk to the last drop and more often than not, a second one gets opened and lasts about half way until I pass out. \\nThe job thing - realized I’m the only one who can help myself there so I have been taking lots of photos and editing them in an effort to update my portfolio but sitting down and editing those photos sober just isn’t an option. I go to work, I laugh with my coworkers, but at the end of the day, the only thing that makes me happy and that I took forward to is that next drink. I started exercising and have been continuing to do so pretty consistently but I always fall off the boat because I can’t stay excited and motivated. \\nLast night I came home to my collection of wine bottles all out and displayed in front of me by my dad. My mom discovered the first bottle in my closet when she couldn’t find my cat, or so she says. She then proceeded to go through every crevice of my room and pulled out the 20 or so I had hidden. Long story short, my life of drinking after work and during my own photo editing hours is over and I am terrified. I feel like I have nothing happy to come home to. I spent all last night crying and today is the first day I didn’t show up to work because of this. The thing is - I don’t know if I want to stop. I’ve had thoughts of suicide since my early teenage years and they have never gone away. I’ve cut myself on numerous occasions. I have dabbled with the idea of overdosing on my anxiety and depression medication. I did go into therapy for a few months but that turned out way too pricey for my minimal salary. My dad has offered to pay for my therapy last night, but this is an offer I’m not sure I want to take. I just want it to be over. The only times things are okay in my brain is when I am sleeping, or when I am heavily buzzed. I don’t have children, nor a boyfriend and I have maybe 2 friends, so I’m finding it difficult to see a purpose to go on. \\nI would like to finish by saying how awful I feel about putting this out there. The amount of times the word “I” is used is upsetting and selfish since I know there are people out there who have it way worse than me. Like my parents have pointed out numerous times, I have nothing to be sad about. I have a good job, a warm house, food and water. I have a car that my dad so kindly gave to me when he bought himself a new one. And they are right. I have it so good. But inside, that dark cloud just won’t lift and there is no way I can describe it in words to someone who hasn’t felt the pull of it.\\nThank you, from the bottom of my heart to anyone who read this fully, attempted to read it, or even glanced at it.

My problem is that I basically just sit in my apartment all day watching T.V. or playing games. I\\'ve met a handful of people either in the halls, or knocking on doors when I first moved in (just to introduce myself and \"say hi\" - which took a LOT of courage for me as I\\'ve got social anxiety and fear the heck out of getting out of my comfort zone.\\nAt any rate, so far I\\'ve met (or at least casually said \"hi\" and at times attempted to start a conversation with to a \"handful\" of people either in the dining hall they have set up for the lunch program I\\'m signed up for or in the hallways. But I frankly can\\'t find pretty much anyone I want to or am capable of even really having a conversation with letting alone really getting to know them. There was one guy that I liked, but he was like in a bad mood that day or is just really introverted (and that\\'s coming from an \"uber-introvert\" LOL) or something like that - he didn\\'t even want to offer up his name.\\nHaving said that, here\\'s my real problem (and likely the point where you all start to \"hate\" me lol/smh):\\n1. I\\'m admittedly somewhat \"bigoted\" if you will against PwD (\"persons w/ disabilities\" for those unfamiliar with the acronym). A \"self-hating PwD\", if you will. It\\'s NOT that I find anything inherently \"wrong\" or \"bad\" with PwD, so much as it is I\\'m so fucking god-damned sick and tired of being labeled as nothing BUT a PwD, and having us always being pigeonholed into having to spend time with one another, because \"normal\" (for lack of a better, more \"P.C.\" term) society doesn\\'t want anything to do with us and \"God forbid\" they actually want to make friends with us or spend time with us.\\n2. I will say, there are a number of people here that are either intellectually (***significantly***) \"below my level\" OR they have some sort of speech impediment (probably from some sort of issue with their brain that interferes with their brain\\'s ability to produce speech or something like that sorry, I\\'m not an expert on those disabilities nor speaking apparently as this is a major run on sentence....sorry) - neither of which there is anything intrinsically wrong with whatsoever, but it DOES severely impact my ability to want to be friends with them or get to know them. I quite simply no longer have the patience anymore to try to get to know somebody who doesn\\'t have the mental capacity to talk about anything more than her apparent obsession with \"kitties\" (true story, there is actually someone here who all she talks about is cats) or to try to discern what someone is saying every time they open their mouths because unfortunately they are so impaired mentally that they struggle to form coherent speech. That\\'s like ***WELL*** over 50% of the people I\\'ve come across so far. And the ones who aren\\'t impaired in those ways that I\\'ve met so far, are either significantly older than me (this apartment\\'s average age I\\'d say is well over 50+ and I\\'m not yet 34) or we just have nothing in common as I\\'m obsessed with sports and movies and T.V. and I have yet to meet a single person here who has the same interests. (NOTE: Sorry I should\\'ve tried to found a way to break this up into more paragraphs, but couldn\\'t figure out a good way to do so).\\nNow, mind you - I know damn well that my inherent biases and SUPER anti-social tendencies are playing a (big?) part here, but I just can\\'t bring myself to find anybody here who I want to get to know or hang out with. For that matter, none of the people I ***have*** introduced myself to so far have bothered to call me or knock on my door or even say \"hi\" in passing me in the hallways.\\nI\\'ve thought about trying to find a way to \"get involved\" in the community *outside* of the building, but between my \"anti-social\" tendencies and fear running my life and scaring the shit out of me in that sense every way possible prohibiting me from doing it so far, the other problem I have with it, is there is basically only about a 3-hour window - maximum - that I want to fill during the **daytime** hours (roughly 12-ish to 4:45-ish, my shows start at 5:00).....including transportation, which having to rely on \"para-transit\", means I could spend most of that time waiting).\\nAnd even that time I could probably spend catching up with shows I\\'ve missed that I want to see on demand. Basically, as has been the case for as long as I can remember, I\\'m a T.V. (and computer) ADDICT - and I\\'m largely okay with it, except I know it\\'s unhealthy and antisocial. Ideally, I\\'d LIKE to be more social, but between being addicted to my electronics and being scared to death of socializing and the prospect of socializing with a bunch of people in the building that quite frankly I don\\'t seem to *want* to get to know (and they\\'ve certainly made no attempt to get to know me with the exception of one old lady who we don\\'t have much in common, and she\\'s already admitted that I\\'m a \"dick\" - which I already knew so I wasn\\'t offended, the idea is less than appetizing. (NOTE: thankfully, she doesn\\'t seem to mind that I\\'m a dick, but again we only ate lunch together one time and I never got her apartment number and I haven\\'t seen her since).\\nSo to make a long story short - how do I get over my fears, and out of my funk, while still maintaining the things I enjoy (like surfing the net and binge-ing on T.V.) ?

I've been through alot for only being 19 and my years before age 14 had alot of bad shit connected to it that im not 100% teady to talk about.  At 14 I finally cut contact with my drug addict father after he tried to get my siblings and I taken by the state (again) and get my step dad thrown in jail for false accusations of rape on my little sister. That alone was just a bad time. He called me the night i filed a restraining order to tell me he was going to kill himself and it was my fault, that he hoped i was happy that I caused it. Fast forward 3 months and I was told by my doctor that I have something genetically wring with the muscles and joints in my knees and they needed to do surgery. Fine whatever its just to check on things and I was fine after a week of rest. All they did was clean up scar tissue. However i had just started highschool and was in a junior ROTC program through the army. I was excited and wanted to make a difference that my POS father refused to. I loved this program it was my family and I made really good friends. I joined their shooting team and made it my goal. I got good, really good, too 10 in the nation good . My coach and instructors were ther closest thing to a father I had. I loved them and I felt safe with them. A year goes by and my surgeon tells me he was wrong. He had missed something and thats why I was in pain, he ended up doing an extensive surgery on me at 16, cutting bone and screwing it in at another spot, cutting muscle and ligaments to release pressure and cutting into one of my hamstrings so I wouldn't loose the ability to walk. Recovery for that was terrible. I couldn't walk, couldn't shoot, couldn't do much of anything. I gained probably 40 pounds over my 3 month recovery. I had finally recovered from it and was back in swing and ready for my first big event with my friends. It was an annual ball that the rotc puts on and I was finnally back with my family, couldn't do much but back. I remeber that night because it was one of the last times I felt complete. I was invites to another party a week after but I had to turn it down, my leg wasn't ready and I just couldn't.  I went to sleep early and woke up with over 100 notifications. Come to find out my best friend who had invited me the night before had gotten in an accidnet and died on the way home.I was shaken to my core. His back up driver was shit faced and killed him and it was all becuase I wasn't there. A month later I was at his funeral and we were able to give him a send off to be proud of, all I remember was crying. I had lost one of my two bestfriends, the people who stood by me and had to torn apart relationships in the process of grieving. That excat night another tragedy struck, the third in our trio, a friend of mine sense elementary had passed away from complications with the flu. I was absolutely devastated. I couldn't function. Both of my pillars just died within a month of eachother. I threw myself into shooting and my coach. He was all the support I had left. Fast forward 6 months to the summer. My surgeon had just told me the day before that my other leg needed the same procedure and I could no longer be eligible for military service, the next day I rolled my car down a 30 foot embankment trying to swerve around two dogs. Once I was out of the hospital my coach called me to check on me and told me we would get breakfast after his hiking trip. My coach was epileptic but always loved to go on adventures, he was the classic Jersey stereotype with a heart of gold. I loved that man with everything I had. He was all I felt I had left. He ended up having an episode while hiking and fell of the side of a cliff,  they found his body the next morning on a rock on the river. I was completely devistated, I didnt know what to do but luckily I had made one more friend that I could talk too. I got my second surgery and gained more weight from the depression and lack of movement. This guy became my best friend, helped me through alot and let me vent to him. Flashforward to last month. He is on trial for child sex abuse and has confessdd to it but is now fighting it. I know he is guilty and being a victim of sexual abuse as a child I hate him for it. One of my last friends raped and abused his fathers girlfriend's daughter for years. Here I am now in college across the state and I am beyond lost with no true direction to follow.

I have 2 parents who have given me the world, and I am the oldest sibling of 4. I have had a great education all of my life, I went to an awesome university in my town but I had to take a gap year due to my mental health issues. I live on the East Coast, and I have all of the opportunities in the world to live the life I dream of living. I have a therapist, a beautiful house, an absolutely amazing boyfriend, and some close friends. Nowadays though, the life I dream of living consists of these few things: Energy, excitement about my days, and a positive outlook. At this rate, switching my major, finishing college, and moving along in life feels impossible. \\nI took a gap year because the lifelong anxiety I had was starting to take a toll. Originally I had just planned to take a semester off because I wanted to go to therapy and then get back to school. I didn’t want to be out for too long because I thought I wouldn’t want to go back. But that was in September. It’s now March, and after having mono for a few months, not being in school, struggling with anxiety, feeling lonely partially because I am not in school and I’m watching all of my peers live the life I had planned for myself, coupled with mental illness, I have developed depression. At first my psychologist didn’t think I was depressed, because the symptoms of mono coincide with depression. Also, some people have a depressive episode when their anxiety is very bad, which mine was. Luckily it’s a bit better now. But the depression has taken the front row seat now, so that rains on my parade pretty badly. I also talked about the fear of becoming depressed a lot, too. But now fast forward, I most certainly have depression. We are aware of this now. \\nWhat I don’t understand about depression, and never did until I was diagnosed, is the feeling of being hopeless and having nothing to live for, like many depressed people talk about. I used to think, “how could you feel hopeless? There are so many beautiful things in this world. There are so many beautiful places, faces, moments, things to look back on and things to look forward to. You have so many talents and so many amazing qualities, and you make people so happy without even realizing it”. But now, I understand. \\nI truly understood the hopeless feeling when I started realizing the amounts of mental and physical energy it took for me to perform mental tasks... to even *want* to do them, and have a reason for them. My body feels like a rock that I am lugging around. I feel like I don’t even have the capacity to think like I used to, yet somehow I still have all of the energy to overthink. But my creativity is stifled, I don’t see the world as colorfully as I used to, and it feels like even on the nicest of days the world is still the gray winter we’ve had here for so long. I just **don’t have the energy** for almost anything. And sometimes I will get myself going, but I don’t feel as if I am doing my tasks or feeling things the way I used to. I don’t feel full of life and wonder anymore. Small moments don’t bring me a boatload of joy. I used to pride myself in finding happiness and joy in the little things, but now my surroundings feel dull and it’s always like I’m searching for something bigger. Which I know isn’t the issue here. It’s just my brain. I drove to Philly with a friend about 3 weeks ago on a Saturday just for fun, and I thought the new environment would make all the difference, but it just didn’t. I was definitely filled with more enthusiasm than I usually was, but I could only keep that energy for so long. And once again, I didn’t feel how I used to feel before all of this hit. So, back to my original point. I feel hopeless. Because how am I supposed to get anywhere with this lack of motivation and energy? \\nI simply just don’t have the energy or stamina to maintain the activities I need and want to do. I know what’s good for me, what *should* be good for me and making me happy. After all, it used to. But I am always tired in some way. I never feel well rested. I used to be active and energetic but now my body is telling me to lay down, even if it’s bad for my brain. I tell myself I should take care of myself the way a parent would take care of a child. That my body is worth taking care of. But **I am just so sick of FORCING myself to do things. And then not being able to create habits because of the amount of energy it takes. And then feeling totally hopeless.** \\nI do not want to “accept” that I’m depressed. I don’t even like saying I’m depressed, and I hate it even more when people say it isn’t curable. How isn’t it curable? I didn’t have it my whole life. Maybe the signs were there subtly, but if I knew about them, I could’ve done something before I hit this barrier. \\nMy family has done everything for me and I love them so much. I really do. I absolutely love my parents. My mom is so creative, free spirited, stubborn, funny, and on the go. My dad is wise, determined, nurturing, hilarious, and level headed. My siblings all have minds of their own, too. My sister is adventurous and creative like me. My brothers are, well, my brothers. Haha. My grandma is an absolute saint. But a lot of the time, especially recently, it’s hard not to distance myself from my parents when I feel so down. I just feel like the disappointment who is always being watched because of my vulnerable mental state. Everything is always about what I’m not doing, and I know it’s because they care and think me doing things will help, but it’s just not that simple. I get irritable, and this causes tension. I kind of isolate myself from them. Not really, but I just don’t initiate conversation with them. I feel awkward. I’ll fix this but it’s just hard. \\nSomehow — I hate admitting this because I never wanted to get to a place where I felt my significant other was one of the biggest sources of my happiness because it’s unhealthy — my boyfriend makes me feel more alive than most things anymore. It won’t be this way forever, but right now it is. Maybe God, or the universe, or whoever, placed him in my life for a reason. He is the most positive, energetic, happy, stress free, level headed, patient, caring, affectionate, hilarious, awesome person I know. This kid reassured me everyday, just because he **feels** like it, of how much he loves me, how I make him the happiest kid in the world, how I brighten his days, how I make him laugh like nobody else, and any other sweet thing you can think of. And to me, they aren’t cliches because I know he means them. He reassured me that he knows who I am outside of this depression. He loves me for me. And he constantly reminds me that he is here with me every step of the way, that he believes in me, and that he will not leave my side. It blows my mind. I don’t understand it, but man is it relieving. I cannot even explain how much I love him. He just **never** gets frustrated with me, and always prioritizes my happiness. He lives an insanely well balanced life, good for him. He has perfect mental health, and I envy it but I’m more so just grateful to have someone like that in my life. Honestly, he’s been a saving grace some days. \\nI want to get back in school as soon as possible. I want to know how to build myself back up so that I can have a daily routine, and energy, and be excited. I don’t want to feel like my brain and body are stifled anymore. I want myself back. I struggle so much with feelings of “is this worth it?” Because is it? People would surely miss me, but what about *me*? How am I supposed to live if I feel like everything is a matter of me dragging myself out of a ditch? \\nI wish that I could go back in time, and almost just watch my young self from afar. I was so happy go lucky. Spunky. Happy. I wish I could just hold my own hand, and see my smile and take it with me into the future. \\nSometimes I get really scared because I have thoughts about dying. I don’t want to die and I don’t want to commit suicide but what if I become that way to escape the pain? And I go nuts? And I lose my boyfriend and those who matter to me? \\nI wouldn’t wish depression upon anyone. If you read to here then thank you. And if you have any advice, I’m dying to hear it.

Probably with myself?  \\nI\\'m a 22 years old male from Switzerland. Right now it is 3 am here.   \\nWhen I was 11/12 I became very heavily depressed and apathic due to a traumatic childhood, but also further traumas throughout my life made it worse. Therapists didn\\'t notice it and prevention of any further psychological damage was quite late.   \\nI lived a toxic childhood, youth and young adulthood and noticed me being \"different\" when I burned out and everything I bottled up for 18 years just bursted out of me, so I lost my sanity for quite a while and was put down in a mental hospital  \\nAt this point my personality already manifested in a very self destructive way and it was diagnosed as a \"combined personality disorder\". Mental hospitals made my symptoms worse and therapists struggled helping me to an extend where I\\'ve been told \"I can\\'t help you.\".\\nI just recently came out of a very toxic and devastating relationship. Where I finally managed to open up to my partner, who was 4 years older than me. Just to be lied and cheated on, which was, according to her, my fault. I used to get very aggressive in response and use that aggression to become a better version of myself, work out more disciplined, study harder, work better.  \\nBut at this point I\\'m just exhausted. So much that I just stopped caring about anything. Mental pain wasn\\'t easy, but I knew I was alive nonetheless, I always had some shimmer of hope no matter how bad my life was, no matter how many people I\\'ve lost and been betrayed by.  \\nBut now I\\'m here, in the middle of the night not knowing how I feel, I don\\'t know if I feel good, if I feel bad or sad. The voices in my head are gone but at the same time so very empty.  \\nI feel empty, nothing more, nothing less. Pure darkness so deep you feel like you could fall down and never land on ground again.\\nI struggle sleeping, because my mind wants to repeat the past and revisit negative feelings/traumas over and over again. I don\\'t just struggle trusting, I\\'m even paranoid at this point. If a person is nice to me, I immediately expect this person to hurt me at some point. I don\\'t wanna feel alone anymore, I don\\'t wanna **be** alone no more. This is all I\\'ve wanted and expected from my partners.\\nI\\'ve met this girl recently. Very friendly, nice, beautiful and she understands me quite well.  \\nBut I see her as a threat, to me, my soul, my shattered heart. Something that could losen my sanity even more. As if she\\'s the next to add more oil to the fire until it becomes an inferno, another crack into the wall until it breaks and falls apart.   \\nI\\'ve never had anyone in my life who was truely by my side. Only people pretending to be.  \\nBut now she\\'s here, offering me help, and I\\'m here, struggling to take it. This isn\\'t about her, more about something I noticed. I\\'ve never been offered an ear like this, it feels like somebody really means it this time because she\\'s been through similar problems and traumas in life. Usually I\\'d not have to react because I knew it was just a friendly gesture and not really meant to help. More of a noble act to add something more to their superior ego.\\nToday everything I bottled up the past few days, weeks, months and during my most recent relationship rocked down on my chest and the sadness struck upon me. I felt like I\\'d go insane and would need somebody by my side, somebody understanding me from deep down their heart and giving me the feeling of not being alone.   \\nI thought about the offer she made. I said to myself: \"This would be just what I\\'d need right now\", and was about to accept the offer, tell her that I\\'d need her right now, that she should come by. But at this point it felt like my hand could not reach her, as if something is stopping me, blocking me, pulling me away.   \\nThe more I wanted to do it, the more I tried to overcome it, the more it got painful, I felt like bones and muscles were breaking and twisting the closer I got to it. An incredible pain of my negative and darker sides, like dark hands pulling me away and whispering \"This isn\\'t what you want, what we want\".  \\nAnd I didn\\'t. I\\'ve let go of it. Pulled my hand away. And sat down, together with all my negativity just like a meet up, surrounded by my past and all the horrible pain I\\'ve been through before. Staring at my wall in pure emptiness.\\nThinking about it, I noticed asking for it made me feel selfish, egoistic. Things I\\'ve been told in my past repeatedly by people I looked up to, until it got manifested in my mind, that asking for help is something for the weak, that it is egoistic to impose your very own burden on somebody else, to drag and pull down somebody else into your darkness, just because of their bright and shiny light. The reason why I hesitated, struggled and finally gave up on it.\\nSo I\\'m sitting here, wondering \"Is it okay to ask somebody else for help?\".  \\nOfcourse people say it is okay to accept help from a person you love or who is close to you.   \\nBut I also know that people like me, depressed and mentally ill ones, can be hard to handle. We can be complicated and contradictory because of our defense mechanisms. And I\\'m wondering how much of a pain and burden I could be to someone as soon as I accept the offer of help.   \\nAs if the person is about to get into an oath with me, a bond that letting go of has the condition of me getting hurt and disappointed again. Which I think I can not bear another time, because I\\'m exhausted.   \\nAt the same time, all I\\'d need, want and appreciate, is what I always lacked, pure warmth of a person, that I feel is coming out of the heart, that calms me during this chaotic storm called \"Life\".\\nThere\\'s this one particular thought that is bugging me, every single day, the past few years.  \\nSomething I always ask myself when I found myself deep down in my dark hole, isolated and distanced from every human being.

It\\'s honestly hard to look directly at her. This is a bit of a ramble. The point is that I developed a huge crush on her. And it hasn\\'t gone away. I thought perhaps that it\\'d be an infatuation that would fade over time, but instead I find myself thinking about her constantly.\\nI\\'m typically an indecisive, hesitant person, in general.

What if we actually date for a decent amount of time but then we break up and we\\'re stuck in this program together? I don\\'t want things to be awkward. I don\\'t want the rumors and the drama and the appearance of unprofessional behavior. I don\\'t want the distraction from this very difficult program. When would I even find the time to attempt such a relationship?* There were just too many variables.\\nAfter a while, though, those questions and concerns seemed to matter less and less. They were still there, but I started to come around to the idea that I needed to do something. I couldn\\'t just have this crush and be in agony. I needed to act. I decided I would invite her out to hang out as friends, and if things went well, I would ask her out. Not a bad idea, right? I would look for signals and see if we have a real connection outside of school.\\nI saw her today at school. She came in and sat by me and another classmate, for no reason. She really just came in to hang out with us.

I\\'m probably overthinking this.* \\nWe were working together for a few hours, but she says she has to stop real quick and let her friend in to the building.

I have found my self being depressed and lonely for most of my life and it's become a part of me. A big part. - my depressing life story : I think it started back in middle school(grade 5) when I moved countries and came to north America. I was seen as an outsider by the other kids and targeted as a easy victim of playground bullying. I learned from it and even managed to start playing at lunch time with the same kids that bullied me by the time middle school came into its final year(grade 7). After this I would enter highschool and out of fear I befriended as many people as i could when i first joined. After grade 8 in highschool i would move to another highschool in a different city(and then again). In highschool i started sleeping 12 hours a day, i would sit on my phone in the washroom for an hour or more, i would take showers and baths for more than an hour. Basically I had turned myself off and with my family being as stressed as they were with their finances I became the emotional punching bag at home. Any frustration in our house would basically result in me getting an earfull(sometimes for 3-4 hours of me gettting yelled at and yes its me getting yelled at when 95% of the conversation is not me). Being emotionally turned off was extremely painful because i was a teenager trying to look for his place in the world and hoping for someone to take notice in me and give a fuck about me. As a result i began to be extremely closed off and would feel lonely no matter where i was or how many people were around me. After highschool we moved from canada to the states and life hit that reset button another time. It would be a good year of not having any friendships before i started college. And even with college i felt disadvantaged as all the other students had their own cars and wore much nicer clothes than i did(the yezees had just came out and i was the only one in the group without a pair). At this point i starting realizing that i was not necessarily privileged and that my parents had tried their best to keep me from that reality. The depression had caught up with my education as it always did and I was basically a moving peice of meat. I was completely absent in my mind and had latched on to smoking weed on a daily basis to make everything numb so i wouldnt feel the pain and i could ignore my own thoughts. Obviously this is not a good state for a student and i got kicked out of college with a gpa of 0.4...yes 0.4. I decided to move back to canada on my own and well its been a year and iv been through hell and back. I was abused right and left by employers. I couldn't even hold a job at McDonalds or at a grocery store. I worked in construction in the rain, the snow, the blaring sun and wind. I keep going through job after job and can never mange to get a rhythm that other adults seem to get into seamlessly. I borrowed thousands from my family just in the course of the past year and as of right now i dont even have enough credit to buy a decent meal let alone pay my rent. I feel like im hurting myself and everyone around me because im not emotionally stable enough to care for my self. Oooh and did i mention i have no friends or social life because well if i go out to grab a drink i cant even afford that. I think twice before buying a $2.50 bus ticket. I feel completely hopeless and lost. Im not necessarily suicidal but iv been suicidal many times before and thats probably the only reason I wont allow myself to be suicidal(basically i can see that road and i see it as a roundabout).

I didn’t want to cuddle him or show him any affection. I didn’t feel normal. \\nI was petrified of bonding with him because I felt that if I lost him it would completely end me. I became a recluse and avoided interacting with anybody; I was only content when I was sleeping. I felt empty, as if I was merely existing. \\nMy wife quickly realised how detached I was from reality. Often she’d be talking to me and I’d blankly stare into space, not taking in anything being said. \\nI often saw how great my friends were with their children and I didn’t get the same thrill and enjoyment. I was upset as I felt surely I should be feeling the same way with my child. \\nWhen Noah was a couple of months old, my wife convinced me to see my doctor, who concluded I was dealing with postpartum depression.\\nBefore my diagnosis, I wasn’t even aware men could get postpartum depression. However, the doctor explained that I was normal, before prescribing me antidepressants and counselling sessions. \\nIn time, I gradually rebuilt my confidence and formed a bond with my beautiful and wonderful son. When we lost our first baby, it felt impossible to move forward and although I’ll never forget our first child, Noah brings that light back into my life.\\nHe’s nearly two now and so intelligent. He has so much love to give. Noah and my wife offer my life a sense of purpose and without them, I don’t know where I’d be.

They provide tangible symbols of remembrance for parents bereaved through miscarriage, stillbirth or neonatal death. We hadn’t heard of them before, so having them show us love and support in our difficult time was heartwarming.  \\nIn time, my wife and I would love more children, but there will always be a sense of anxiety after our first experience.

I’m gonna try to label the sections in all caps so if anyone wants to skip around they can. Also I’m on mobile so I’m sorry for the formatting )-: \\nINTRO: I (22f) attend a university in the US and am in a major where there’s only like 20 students in my “grade” (like freshman, sophomore, etc.) and we are all in the same classes together and have been for four years, so it’s hard to meet other people. We have all also had the same group of professors for four years. So we all are very familiar with each other. \\nI’m a senior and it is my last semester, I graduate this May. The head of the department is very involved and is making sure that each of us individually are on the track to graduating. \\nBACKGROUND: As a little background I have had severe anxiety and depression for as long as I can remember. I also have mild PTSD. I’m in a situation where my mom raised me by herself and was a great mom but also was incredibly verbally and emotionally abusive so I basically am terrified of confrontation, am a huge people pleaser, definitely do not do anything to stand out, and I follow directions and I do what I’m supposed to do (which is get decent grades, live independently and take care of my two pets, it just worked out that I work at a wonderful job that wants to take me on after I graduate, basically I’m just trying to be successful so my mom is proud of me). I have been seeing a therapist and psychiatrist actively and seeking treatment, but I have relapsed a handful of times. \\nThroughout my college career, it never fails that at some point in the semester there is a week or two where I fall into a depression pit and get too anxious to leave home but I still complete my projects (my major is VERY project based) and have never missed a deadline. I have never failed a class before. During these times I have been quite open with specific professors because there is an attendance policy in place where you can have 3 unexcused absences and after that your grade is affected. I have spoken so far to 3 professors and they have all been super wonderful and empathetic and willing to work with me. \\nFor my senior project, I am as far along as everyone else and continue to produce work even though my mental health has been suffering recently. My studio professor got hired about a year ago give or take and we have never had him before as a professor so none of the seniors know him well. The senior studios are split up into two classrooms, so there are two professors but we are all working on our final projects. My professor is incredibly rude and snarky and has an attitude with everybody. He has called students incompetent and told one particular girl that she didn’t have the ability to become our profession. He yelled at another student in front of everyone before. His work load is insane and way more work than the other senior studio. Today they just turned in a deadline that we turned in two weeks ago. Not only does he want us to work on our senior project but he wants to throw all kinds of extra assignments in there when that’s not the point of the class. It’s to do our final thesis project. \\nSITUATION: Recently I had missed a few weeks of school because I was going through intense shit with my mom, I was physically ill with the flu and then I got a sinus infection on top of that, but was keeping him updated. I got a note from an urgent care type place stating that I was ill with a flu like virus and I sent a picture of it to him in an email. I did not attend class the next day either because duh I have all the flu symptoms. I don’t think he counted that as excused because I didn’t get a note for that day, but I’m not going to pay $80 every day that I’m sick after they already prescribed me medicine and whatever just so I can get a note ???? \\nSo the following week goes by and I’m not getting any better and am getting more symptoms of a sinus infection. Great. Obviously I didn’t go to class. This is where I messed up because I should have gone to the doctor sooner to get an excuse I guess. \\nI was emailing him and telling him that I wasn’t going to class and as we were just working on our projects for the upcoming deadline this literal entire time, I didn’t need to physically be there because I have the software I need for it on my laptop. So I am continuing to work on my project this whooole time. The deadline was that Friday and we were presenting in front of the class and a guest. I was still ill but sucked it up bc it was a presentation. I went to school early to print my project and my sweet boyfriend drove me because he knew I was having a hard time. So I didn’t bring my wallet. Big accident. I went to print my presentation at our printing lab(11 x 17 sheets) and after a freaking insane amount of time wasted because the front desk people weren’t there, I realized that they only take the school cash and my school ID was in my wallet at home. At this point class had already started and I was PANICKING. I could feel my face getting hot and my body shaking. I went outside to get some cool air but it did not help. I was having a panic attack and crying and hyperventilating. I called my boyfriend and said screw this come pick me up because I’m not going in empty handed to explain why I have no presentation while I’m full on sobbing in front of my peers and a guest. \\nI did send him an email before I left and explained what happened. I was SO embarrassed. I profusely apologized, accepted a grade penalty, and explained my mental health issues because this had to do with that and I’ve been able to be open with professors of the same college before with no problem. He didn’t email me back ever, which I was like what the fuck because that was a serious email. \\nSo the next Monday I’m still feeling like shit so I go to the on campus doctor. I have a sinus infection, my ears are clogged so i can’t hear, snot is constantly falling from my nose, I’m constantly coughing. It’s gross. While I’m there I figure I will get a note to excuse last week. The doctor wrote that I was ill last week and the day that I came in, signed and dated it. I sent my professor this email to explain why I was so sick and again he didn’t answer me. \\nFast forward to a few days later and my antibiotics aren’t working. The doctor had prescribed me amoxicillin but I do better with augmentin. I should have mentioned that to him but it didn’t occur to me. I emailed him this note bc it was on the day of class and said my antibiotics are not working this is why I’m not in class. He did not respond for a third time and stated that I would be attending class that Friday. At this point I’m freaking out. He’s purposely ignoring me and I was still incredibly embarrassed and shameful about my panic attack at school so this was just making it worse. \\nThat Friday I did not go. I know I told him I would. But I can honestly say that I didn’t go because of how fucking anxious I was to see his reaction to me. \\nI was a wreck the whole weekend. I cried so hard, had several panic attacks and it was overall not a fun time. My poor boyfriend was doing his best to try to comfort me. He is the only person I talk to other than my therapist. I don’t have any other friends because nobody in my major likes me because of the fact that I miss class a lot and am generally really quiet. My mom has told me its my fault they don’t like me. \\nHe actually ended up cancelling class on that Monday which was a relief for me! So I went on Wednesday. I talked to my therapist that morning and we had planned that I would go in at the start of class and bring him my notes and tell him I wanted to show him my project. I went to go pull out my laptop and pulled up my project to discuss it with him. He came up to me and asked me if these notes were the ones I emailed him. I said yes, I brought them because you never responded to me and I wanted to make sure you got them. He said with an attitude “well you have a lot of unexcused absences”. I started to say something but I only got out “I can-“ at which point he cut me off and said (while there were other students around bc we were at my desk) “I don’t know what you’re going to do but you’re not going to pass”, and this part is fuzzy because I was already blindsided at this point, but he said something to the effect of “and fix whatever else is going on” which I took personally as a jab at my mental health. and then walked away from me and proceeded to call another student up to him to discuss their project. \\nI sat there in disbelief. What the fuck. Right? What the fuck? If I don’t pass this class I will not graduate. If I don’t graduate I lose my job. My family will be SO disappointed, especially my mother who is taking on debt for me to attend college. I sat there for a few minutes and tried to work. I could feel myself getting worked up and I could feel the panic coming. My eyes started watering and I had to get the fuck out of there.  I went outside and didn’t know what to do. I couldn’t call my boyfriend because I knew he was in an exam at the time. I tried calling my therapist but she didn’t answer which I totally understand because she’s super busy but I thought I would try anyways. \\nI took a walk around campus to try to calm down but I eventually ended up behind some dumpsters sobbing and hyperventilating. I called my dad who I have a great relationship with now (not so much when I was younger) and he was really supportive, he talked to me until my boyfriend got out of his exam and could drive me home. \\nI’m at a loss. I attended work the next day and broke down there. They sent me home. I spent the whole day hating myself and sobbing. I have one friend in my major who I consider a very close friend if not my best friend even if I’m not hers. We have been friends for 3 years and she knows almost every detail of my life. I told her about this and she said I needed to meet with the head of our major. She helped me organize my thoughts and write out an email and I sent it last night. \\nNow it’s today and I woke up crying, I genuinely had for the first time suicidal thoughts. My head was pounding and I couldn’t stop obsessing over this. My therapist called me and talked with me for 10 minutes which I appreciate more than she will ever know. She literally talked me off the ledge, she called me while I was sobbing. \\nFast forward and I grew some balls and went to studio. I went straight to my desk and my friend who sits across from me completely ignored me. She didn’t look at me or anything even when I spoke to her directly (which was really only a little conversation but she avoided eye contact) So I just worked on my stuff the whole studio, which is 4 hours long. I wanted to just work on my project but something unexpected happened and my professor assigned an assignment that was due at the end of class, something that he never does. I think he did this bc he thought I wouldn’t be there today. He avoided looking at me the entire class and when he went around to everyone’s desks he went to mine last. Our assignment was to hand draw 5 separate detailed items of our project. He told us a specific example to use, which coincidentally I was already thinking of doing, so I drew it. He came over to me and told me he didn’t get why I put it there and what it has to do with anything. Then he went to the girl next to me and she was like “I don’t know what to draw” and he told her she could draw what I just fucking drew. At the end of class he went around again and spoke to everyone again once except me. \\nAnd now here I am. I really don’t know what to do. I hate myself because I know this situation is my fault and I should have just gone to class. If you made it this far I really really appreciate it.

And I've always been that person that you'd pick the last on the team when you're a captain of a sports game. You wouldn't notice me if were gone, in fact, you wouldn't care or even be happy, some of you have even explicitly told me that you'd wish I were gone. \\nI'm not good at anything and probably won't ever be, I just don't have anything to be recognized for. I offer nothing as a person and if anything I feel like a deadly weight to the people I care about, everyday. No matter how hard I've tried, I've tried both my hardest and not at all at times. People just don't like me, no matter what I do. I dislike myself too, I'm tired of this life, I'm just tired of all of this. I'm contemplating suicide, but just haven't figured out when and where to do it. I know sooner or later I'll probably go through with it though. This pain is just stronger than any emotion I've felt in my life. Yes, I've tried meds... but if anything they made it just harder for me to naturally find joy in things.\\nI see all these talented people commenting on here about how they're feeling the same way as I do, but sincerely they just deserve the world. I'm one of the few people and probably the only person who deserves to feel this way, because I'm just a miserable person. \\nI just wanted to get my feelings out there and want some of you all to know that you're not alone in this and that I sincerely think you deserve the world!

I like boxing so sometimes go to an amateur boxing club near me. Even though the coaches are nice guys, the quality of training isn't great. I know I shouldn't expect too much because it's super cheap like £5 for 3 hour and a half sessions a week but I can't afford much else and don't particularly enjoy it or feel I'm making progress. Before I moved in with my girlfriend and her family I used to go to another boxing club. I much preferred it there - I really liked the coaches, the structure of the sessions and there was a good sense of camaraderie; I made a few friends there but it's too far to travel now. Besides, my parents didn't like me going there because I had a few white collar bouts and admittedly I'm not very good at boxing so I won once but got quite badly beaten up twice and ended up needing a brain scan in hospital.

But recently none of these have been holding my attention and I've been losing interest really quickly. For example I start learning to play a song on guitar and don't get round to practicing for a few days so forget it and move on to another song. I'll start trying to run 2 or 3 times a week to improve my 5k time then I'll be lazy and not bother for 2 weeks. I've been getting better with the weightlifting but similarly I'll miss a few sessions and feel like I'm back at square one. With football I'm so disinterested I won't even watch my team play or bother catching the highlights. With reading I won't get past the first few chapters of a book, and even with playing my Nintendo Switch I'll start a game and get bored.\\nI feel like any hobby I pick up is pointless and I'm never going to get anywhere with it because I started too late (I'm 23 now).

To start, I was neglected by my parents. they where never mean, they didn\\'t let me go hungry, they didn\\'t ignore me, in fact i\\'m still living with them,  they just never pushed me to do anything... ever. When I was 12 they pulled me out of school to move to another state and simply never put me back in school. my dad tried homeschooling me for a month or two but quickly gave up.\\nBecause of this I grew up very shy of other people and never had much luck making friends. I spent my teens mostly in my room playing games, watching movies and not much else. I was very isolated. I can\\'t decide how much blame to level against myself for this. How much should a 15 year old be blamed for not enrolling himself in high school, especially when it doesn\\'t seem to matter to anyone around him?\\nSimilarly they never pushed me to get a job and so i just... never did.I did go to film school (which is a whole, long, sad, depressing story in and of it\\'s self) but nothing came of it. I also spent a few months looking for work but didn\\'t get so much as an email back from anyone. I guess it\\'s not hard to see why when you, an employer, are looking at a 28 year old with no work experience...\\nAbout the only good thing that came out of this was meeting my long time boyfriend which leads me to the second major thing. I met him on line when i was 17 and we\\'ve been together for about a decade now. long distance relationships are hard, but it\\'s even harder to sustain one for so long. I love him more than anything and love being around him. Every year one of us goes to visit the other for a few months and they have been some of the happiest times in my life. that being said there have been some extremely hard times, not the least of which was when he cheated on me.\\nhe\\'s always bee very sexual so I suppose I should have known what I was getting myself into. We had a semi open relationship. it wasn\\'t my idea and after years of arguing we came to a compromise. blowjobs only. it upset me but seemed almost necessary. we only see each other once a year, we where both young and horny (one of us hornier than the other) and it seemed like a fair compromise to let him explore with other people since he couldn\\'t do it with me.\\nHe started becoming infatuated with one of his friends. he told me over and over again that it was nothing serious. i really believe he thought that because one day he came to me, told me that I was right and said he was backing off and told his friend to do this same. about a year later he cheated on me with him multiple times. he broke our rule which he knew i was already not a fan of.\\nwhat you need to understand is, the last two paragraphs take place over years. when ever he would go out with his friends i was always left alone to wonder what he\\'s doing with them. it was constant torture and that\\'s before he cheated on me, and he knew that. it didn\\'t help anything that he was surrounded by people to play around with but I wasn\\'t. I only had him. I\\'m 28 and have only ever been with four people including him. the other three where out of desperation. A way to back at/keep up with him and the only way to, at least in some part, blow off some of that frustration and anger. because of that, it was always awkward and I only saw one of them more than once. I really started to grow to hate sex.\\nwhen he cheated on me it destroyed me. it was the lowest moment in my life. No one to talk to, no real friends, no guidance, nothing. We spent months trying to patch things up. I still loved him and cared about him and didn\\'t want to be without him so... i decided to open the relationship entirely. My only rule was to use a condom (Which he hadn\\'t been). I feel like a door mat... he cheated on me and i rewarded him by not only letting him keep hanging out with the guy (who he says is his best friend) but also let him keep sleeping with him. whenever i was out of contact with him because he was out with his friends my depression and jealousy was crippling. I tore my room apart, was always angry, and was just generally out of control of my own brain.\\nI even tried to see a shrink during this time who ignored the things i wanted to talk about, didn\\'t seem to care at all about this mess, kept fucking up my billing and forgetting to schedule appointments.\\nThe time of year came when we would see each other and it was decided i would go to him this time. he thought if I met the guy that i wouldn\\'t feel so bad. I spent three months there. it was incredibly awkward with his friends and especially that guy. the trip was very stressful. His so called \"best friend\" was a huge dick and constantly made a problem of himself to the point of even my boyfriend losing it on multiple occasions. After the whole mess my boyfriend said he really doesn\\'t blame me for hating him.\\ndespite that, our relationship got back on track. we where doing really well. this was going to be the first year we spent Christmas together. I went there in the summer, then a few months later he came here for Christmas. in between, he put the open part of our relationship on hold which made me really happy.\\nbut now Christmas is over and he\\'s gone back home and we\\'re not sure when we\\'ll see each other again. we\\'re trying to get married but international marriage is difficult and we\\'re currently at a loss. it\\'s always hard when we separate after months together but this time has been much harder. we don\\'t know when we\\'ll see each other again, both of us are very stressed out trying to bring our lives together while also trying to support ourselves individually and, for me, on top of it is the memory of the place i was in last year and i feel myself sliding back to the anger and jealousy. I know it\\'s only a matter of time before he starts fooling around again and i know he\\'s already trying to open the possibility with more of his friends.\\nI don\\'t know how to handle this anymore. i\\'m tired of only having myself to talk to. i\\'m tired of feeling walked on. i\\'m tired of feeling like, even if i wanted to, i don\\'t have the life or personality that would let me participate in this openness.\\nI really do love him and i know he really loves me. When we\\'re together we\\'re inseparable and do EVERYTHING together. but when we\\'re apart it\\'s like i become less important to his life... maybe it\\'s just his defense mechanism for dealing with the distance but when we separate all i want to do is cling to him, he seems to pull away and it\\'s a lot of work to keep things together.\\nSo, my situation is, i\\'m 28, living with my parents, never had a job, have no life skills and very little social skills.

This diagnosis caused me to be separated from the military. At the time I was ok with it. I felt that it was just a sign to move on to another stage of my life. From there I decided to go back to school. I wanted to finish my degree and get a job using that degree. This would have went well but unforeseen circumstances have caused some major issues with that plan. The school isn’t offering the classes that I need to finish the degree for at least a term for one and two for the other courses. With school being payed by the VA and them also providing a housing allowance this was my source of income, but I can’t get that in on if I’m not going to school. I was fully prepared to cut down on spending while I waited to find a job to tide me over. I am married and my wife has a steady job so at least we have some income, but I have been the only one to cut down on the spending. While trying to get my wife to cut down a little bit on spending, she decided to get an additional job to earn a little extra money. Initially I was very happy with that. The thing is she has been always working and I am struggling to get a job. The bills were fine initially but eventually credit card began having higher and higher balances and the savings began dwindling. My wife has been using her second job not to assist in paying the bills but to sequester away to use as fun money. Again no issue initially. Over time it was notice that more an more time and money was spent towards time with her friends while I ended up stuck at home based on the fact that money was leaving faster than it was coming in. I have asked to be included, but she tells me she doesn’t want my negativity around her friends. This hurt me and made me take a close look at the situation. The past year or so communication has really been almost nonexistent between us about the happenings of our lives. This was ok when I was In The military because I spent a large portion of my time at work. I really wanted to push towards better communication and time together when we could get it without cutting out her friends.  I began working my communication while I was busy with school. I made sure to tell her when I had free time so that we could spend time together. Multiple times that I let her know that I was going to be free on a specific day or that I would make time to spend with her when I knew she was free, she would instead make plans with her friends. Time after time of this happening has just beat me down emotionally. It’s even more noticeable now that I am home all the time job hunting and I still get to see my wife less then her friends see her. The combination of the situations that put me in an idle state and it seeming like she doesn’t want to be around me has put me in a very dark place. I have been seeing a counselor with her over the past couple of months in hopes of rebuilding the communication bridge and trying to get her to see how I feel and me to see how she feels about everything. The thing is that whenever a conversation about such things happens between us she glazes over and it seems like no attention is being payed. This again bashed my self worth. The counselor eventually referred me to a medical professional who diagnosed me with major depression and prescribed me medication. The medication helps for the most part, but I keep getting lack of value impressions from my wife that just puts me right back in my hole. Over the past few months I have thought about suicide many many times. I have never thought about doing it, just about how I could do it. This scares the crap out of me. It takes a lot of thinking about my parents and my sister to get those negative thoughts out of my head. I am at a loss though I love my wife so much, and I think my wife loves me in her own way. The thing is us not being on the same page is destroying me, and in turn our relationship. I know it’s not all my fault and that it’s not all hers, it is a combination of everything. I feel like I have been bending over backwards to promote healing in my life and my relationship with my wife. I don’t feel that I am getting the effort back from my wife. I am at a loss of what to do. I can’t seem to dig myself out of this hole and I can’t seem to get the help from my wife because neither of us know how.

So in 11th and 12th grade I tried instead very hard in learning even more math, doing both the IB higher level and Further level Maths. Of course, during that time I spent my free time not revising and doing math in doing my own stuff such as watching animate, playing games, etc.\\nHowever, I always try to take the hardest course in maths, so truthfully a part of me realizes that I do maths not because I like math, but I have some sort of ego and I want to prove to people around me that I am better than them.\\nNow, I reach the point where I took way too much challenging classes in university, and it is almost finals and I find myself playing Minecraft and failing to control myself. Sometimes people ask me if I want to do something or have something to do, and I say \"I am busy\". Then, I say to myself \"I should probably use that time revising\" but end up playing minecraft (or another game but I believe they are still the same idea). I thought I liked maths, so I am supposed to find it as fun doing maths as playing minecraft, but my subconsciousness just push me to play minecraft rather than do maths, and I play several hours without stop, even if I initially allocate a small amount of time on it. \\nSo, here is 2 questions I want to solve, and I want to ask if anyone can guide me to solving it:  \\n1. Why don\\'t I understand myself? How do I know if I really enjoy maths as itself? I am so confused even after 2 years of learning a load of maths.\\n2. What do I want in life? of course I want to feel happiness, but truthfully the only thing I know I want is recognition and for others to love me, and this I am sure I want. I just know this because my whole heart feels happy when I get recognition. Other than that, I really am not sure what I want long-term. Many times I imagine myself mastering all the math concepts and become some math genius, and people recognize me for my hard work and achievements. Another thing I want to say is I am sure I want to love doing math, but what if I don\\'t love math in reality? It feels like many of my hobbies (piano, chess, math) are actually because I was forced or driven to do them in the past, but I don\\'t even like them in reality, because I\\'d rather play something like Minecraft...', 'text_b': None, 'label': 1}, {'guid': 1921, 'text_a': 'I’m doing pretty well in life right now, but I still feel like shit. : I’ve been pretty depressed since October.

I was prescribed antibiotics, but they did not work so I was referred to a specialist who provided me with drops and I was signed off work. The drops cleared the infection but I was still having issues with my hearing, after seeing the specialist the second time I was told that both of my eardrums had chronic perforations and that unless I had surgery I would not be able to hear properly again and there was a 25% chance that even with surgery I would not regain the hearing I had lost. \\nWhen I exited the hospital, I broke down in the street, I was sobbing into my sleeve as I walked, and I was at a total loss of what to do. I had been having negative thoughts for a long while, but I had been able to lift myself from them but now they seemed to be hitting me hard and I began to feel that life just was not worth living.\\nI went home and kept having suicidal thoughts, I kept thinking of ways to end my life without affecting my husband financially, ways in which my death would look accidental in nature. I was home alone for weeks thinking about ways to end my life and I was hiding it from my husband. I did not want to hurt him, for him to see me as a burden in his life or for him to think I was weak and a failure. I kept receiving emails about my situation from work and weeks turned to months and I began to dread having to go to the doctor to ask for a sicknote (which he was more than happy to provide). I lost all purpose and felt like there was nothing in life that I wanted to do. I would make comments about how the anaesthetic from the surgery for my ears might go wrong and then I would not have to think about any of this.\\nIt all came to a head when I was due to return to work and I asked my husband if he could see himself continuing with the same job and he said yes and I looked him in the eyes and simply said I can’t do it anymore. Unfortunately, the timing of this was very poor as we were due to have guests around and he could see that I was in severe distress, but it was too late to cancel. I managed to hold back and after the guests left, we spent the whole night talking, much of which was me sobbing hard about how I did not want to continue to be alive. My whole body hurt; I had been trembling which meant my muscles were sore. My eyes were raw from the tears and from rubbing them. My throat hurt from the gasps of anguish and crying as I explained my issues.\\nMy husband took me to see my GP the next morning and I found it difficult to start the conversation. My husband began and as he told the GP he burst into tears and it broke me again. I don’t think I have ever seen my husband cry. It hurt me to the core to see him so upset. The GP was shocked and immediately prescribed me with antidepressants and information for counselling and support.\\nSince then my mood has been up and down, I try to think about the future but its very hard to be positive or think of things I want to do or achieve. I hate being off work as it makes me feel like a burden, even though I was receiving sick pay and my company is supportive I just wanted to get it over with and continue with my life but the only issue I kept coming up against was doing what? I have no idea.\\nThe feelings of being a burden kept growing stronger, especially as I knew the sick pay would be reduced to half and then I would be financially dependant on my husband which I feel to be unfair and has never happened in the 13 years we have been together. I have worked hard to try and find something I love enough to consider the possibility of doing as a career, but it is a real struggle. I also wanted to try coming off the medication in order to be less drowsy the following day so I could get more things done so I stopped taking it (for two weeks). I decided that as I love animals, I would try home boarding as an option and in order to relive myself of the pressure to return to my old job I handed in my resignation. My employer was very reluctant to accept the resignation but I honestly did not see me ever being able to return to that role and if I did I am sure that the feelings would build up again and I would end up in the same position. \\nMy first experience of home boarding was awful, within an hour of receiving the dog I felt pressured, stressed and anxious so much so that I ended up in tears and back on my medication, I was constantly berating myself. The owner stated the dog was house trained and friendly to other dogs (I have two dogs myself) but this was not true, and I was having to juggle a very energetic animal with my own pets. My husband kept offering to help but as he had been working all week, I kept telling him no, that this was my responsibility as he had already done his working week. But I couldn’t cope. The dog managed to run upstairs and peed on the spare bed which again caused me to get upset. The dog was uncontrollable, unresponsive to commands and not house trained; the idea to be a home boarder now felt horrible and I recalled handing in my notice and asking myself “what have I done?” The dog also had separation anxiety and I did not want this to affect both me and my husband so I slept in a separate bed with the dog in the room, shushing it every 30 minutes and hoping it did not rip up the carpet, skirting, door or anything else. Needless to say, I did not sleep well that night. \\nThe next day I asked my employer if it would be possible to rescind my  resignation and assign me to a part time position, on a lower grade with lesser responsibilities but as I have offered my resignation it is up to them if they accept this. I know my husband will support me to find a new job, so this is not an issue for me, but I still feel reckless for just leaving to try something new without having tried it first. I guess it is a lesson learnt.\\nIn all this time I have been on group therapy sessions, received counselling and have used the support service ‘shout!’ and have been more open about my feelings with my husband when I am having a particularly bad day. I realised how much I love to write, and I am now considering looking at this as a possible career in the future. I am going to take one day at a time and explore the opportunities I have available to me and I will go back to work even if it is part time whilst I decide what I really want to do.\\nI can’t say that I am cured but I do feel that I have made some progress. Without talking to my husband as scary as it was or going to my GP to seek support, I don’t think I would be here today. I urge anyone who has felt like I have, to seek help.

What matters the most is it makes you feel good.\\nPlay your music and just let go. Start imagining and believing everything that you want in life you have it already. The feeling of being complete and loving yourself. Some things I think about: Im sexiest mothefucker out there, I have a perfect life, im in perfect health, im the greatest of all time. Im blessed. You should be feeling this loving energy near your heart. It feels good kinda blissful. Just let go and feel that you have everything. You are not thinking about anything negative.

Everything starts with you.\\nThis technique will make you a more positive person and you will start feeling happy for no reason.

So I decided to help the people that are not feeling happy. (Not being happy can have many causes therefore I can not guarantee that the method that I am going to explain will help for everyone.)\\nFirst of all I want to say that I do not recommend you to suppress your emotions. Feeling emotions can be helpful in many ways. It can for example tell you that you do not like certain things or that certain things need to be changed. But as a child probably almost everyone told you ¨I want you to be happy¨. Therefore you started to feel bad if you did not feel happy. So you feel even more bad than you did before. But like I just said, your emotions can be helpful in many ways. So you do not have to feel bad about it if you are not happy.\\nIn today's society most people are raised in a way that they start thinking constantly. And if you observe these thinking patterns you start to see that most people are just repeating their thoughts over and over again. And at a point they even start thinking about their own created thoughts that they are repeating over and over again. Therefore they have nothing to think about except thoughts. And then there comes a point that they are just living in their head. And because of that they are not seeing the beauty of life anymore. People can go to work everyday and if you ask them for example ¨Did you see the appletree at the side of the road when you was on your way to work?¨ They will probably say ´´No I didn't see it´´. So they are just caught up in their thoughts not experiencing life anymore. So try to still your mind, by for example meditation (If you want mediation techniques, feel free to ask, you can even send me a dm @quintenvanommen.) Once your are not caught up in your thoughts anymore you can start experiencing life again. On your way to work you can see the appletree, you can see the apples, you can see the apples falling. And if you eat you are just eating. Your are experiencing the apple or whatever you are eating. And than if you drink afterwards a cup of tea for example. Just drink the cup of tea and taste the tea.

We've had a very turbulent relationship with a lot of breaking and making up, intense love and our fair share of troubles. Maybe I'm just romanticizing the word toxicity but to be completely honest I wouldn't have wanted it any other way.\\nWe used to be extremely jealous of each other and sort of isolated our self from the world together. Thinking back I do regret this a lot. Due to our mix of toxicity and her depression we both suffered abuse from each other. It's crazy how an extreme love for a certain person can drive you insane and even make you do unloveable things to them.\\nIn high school we used to spend almost everyday together and I loved it this changed after we went to college. When we graduated high school she went to Sweden for 7 weeks and we really started having a lot of relationship difficulties from there. I sort of started disconnecting and getting used to having more space. After she returned we noticed that we had both changed a lot and this led to a lot of fights but slowly but surely we kind of started having a healthy relationship. This took a lot of hard work, sacrifice and communication.\\nEverything changed when this happened however. Around the first year of the relationship we both promised each other to stop watching porn because it made us insecure. I did this for a long time but eventually relapsed around 8 times in the span of a year and never told her. She eventually had a suspicion and confronted me, I confessed and everything just went extremely downhill from there. She was really hurt and even more so about the fact that I hid it from her and was never planning on telling. We broke up after this but got back together after a couple weeks had gone by. Her trust however was never the same (and rightfully so).\\n# Her situation/depression\\nMy girlfriend originally started suffering from depression at 16 due to her birth control pills. I've been supporting her ever since. The first months it was really bad and she even tried taking her own life with sleeping pills she saved up. I called emergency services when this happened and she was taken to the hospital and given mental treatment after this all happened. There was a big problem however when she came home.\\nAfter hating me for a couple of days and wishing that I didn't call emergency services she finally told me the real reason why she wanted to die. It turns out that she was a gypsy, a Romani. And in their culture children have to be in arranged marriages at extremely young ages. Now its 16/18 but it used to be a lot younger. And it has to be with another gypsy otherwise the female is considered a whore and an outsider and is shunned by the entire family. I always thought that my girlfriend had strict parents but never to this extent I never asked any questions about why they couldn't know about us but now I knew.\\nShe always had a really good relationship with her mom but after the day she tried to commit suicide their relationship was strained for a very long time. Her mother (father is out of the picture) didn't believe in mental health and thought she was doing this to get attention which of course triggered my girlfriend even more. She also could never tell the full story to her mental health counselors because they would have to enable child protective services.\\nShe eventually made the choice to run away with me. But she seemed very conflicted about this and kind of flip flopped between staying with her mom and living for her and being with me. A lot of the times she did not want to make a choice because she felt she would be unhappy in both situations. A loveless (probably abusive) arranged marriage or an unstable relationship with me. She convinced herself dying was the best option eventually. I talked her out of it so many times and truly tried supporting her through everything. This took a large toll on me as she would often be really abusive.\\nEverything changed when I cheated however. She told me in the weeks that we broke up that I was the reason she was going to die and I was her only chance at a normal life. I tried to convince her otherwise but she just won't listen. After we got back together she told me she was going to die regardless of her relationship and she's just waiting for the right time. When I begged her not to she refused to change her choice and told me it was going to happen this year and I get to choose to be with her till the end or leave. When I asked why she said because I cheated and we would never be the same after this anyway.\\nI thought I could change her mind at first but I can't. I honestly don't know what to do anymore I see a future with this girl but she doesn't with me. I told her I'm going to think about my choice and she called me selfish. Supporting her through all of those years of this took a toll on my sanity,sleep and social life. I can't sit there and be with her until she dies. I don't understand how she wants to take me back after everything but doesn't want to run away with me anymore. I'm confused tired and stressed out. I've never talked about this with anyone and I just need to hear someone else's opinion on this.\\n# My final decision\\nI still havent decided what to do and told her I want to think about this long and hard. She told me I was selfish and compared me to the devil for leaving her with the depression and letting her die alone. I really need some advice.\\nI really don't want to be a temporary comfort for her I just can't. I love her to death and want to grow old with her and have a good relationship. I would permanently lose my sanity if I stayed I'm afraid but I also don't want to leave her like this.\\nI know a large part of our relationship troubles seem really immature and they are. But we were both really young and we still are and these are all just extremely hard choices to make at this age.\\nTL;DR: My girlfriend is going to kill herself and wants me to be with her till the end.

I suspect this is going to be really f\\\\*\\\\*\\\\*\\\\*\\\\*g long, so very sorry about that. Hope some of you stick with me to the end.\\nOk so context: I have a few mental health issues, most notably big time depression which has an organic cause. That means it doesn’t necessarily originate from any life event, and instead is an inescapable, life-long and not-very-treatable condition that results from my brain being wired like shit. Over the past 15 years or so (I’m 29) I’ve been steadily isolating myself and I never really learned how to form like personal connections beyond the shallowest kind (and those were mostly by proxy. Friends of friends, stuff like that). I did try to kill myself at one point, a few years ago, when I was at a specially low point. And it turns out I’m really bad at suicide, which is probably the only reason I haven’t tried again yet because if you try and fail to kill yourself there’s a lot of drama and it’s exhausting. And honestly I don't have the energy to try and make a life I'm content with, it just sounds too... too much.\\nAnd since then, well… I’d mostly accepted that being alive wasn’t something that I liked very much. I derive(d) very little pleasure from anything, endlessly tortured myself psychologically because when I felt bad at least I felt something, and didn’t have much of an interest in completing my education, finding a job, moving out of my parents’ home… Y’know, just generally having a life. I had sort of accepted, in a truly chill way, that I was merely existing between depressive episodes and that the next one very well could be the one to push me over the edge, so why bother? I was going to die, and honestly it was going to be soon, and there were means and there was planning. Most of the time, going through life without an escape plan (by which I mean suicide) was simply impossible. Like, I probably wouldn’t have lived to see August. I was considering my birthday, which on the one hand has the very nifty way of reducing peak grief days for my family and stuff, but on the other hand commiting suicide on your 30th birthday is just like ugh.\\nAND THEN, like a month ago, it just fucking went away. Like, I’m not FINE fine, but for the first time since I can remember I’m in a genuine, sort of stable good mood. I have energy, I am making some (SOME) good choices, I want to surround myself with people. For the first time in my life I’m thinking that maybe it would be nice to have a job, one that pays just well enough to move out and live with roomates or something. Learn how to deal with people, because currently I just don’t know how to people, and perhaps one day have a romantic relationship. Or several!\\nI’m not going to lie, I didn’t exactly welcome this change. I don’t know where it came from (I’ll get there sorry this is so long), or what to do with all that energy, or what I’m feeling most of the time because I have no context for any of this emotions. And a little later I just started to be terrified, all of the time, that one day it’s going to go away and never come back. I’m still terrified and confused and all that, but somehow it doesn’t detract from my good mood because now I’m a positive person I guess. Disgusting.\\nOKAY, that was context, so sorry for the rant. Here comes another one.\\nSo around the time this started, I was starting to hang out a bit more often with some friends of friends, always as a group. I like them very much, and I knew one of them beforehand. He’s really nice and the kind of person I would really like to hang out one-on-one (which we have, once, I think) if I knew how to like bond with people and talk to them just because, and if one-on-one weren’t such a terrifying thing. Kind of a mess, he is, but like in a sometimes endearing way. A bit sitcomy I guess. And while I honestly don’t know (because I don’t know anything anymore), I’m starting to fear that I might have a bit of a crush on him, which would be all-around terrible for several reasons.\\nFirst, feelings? Gross. I’ve rarely liked a guy. Hell, I haven’t ever kissed a boy I had feelings for. I’ve kissed many, fucked even more (rarely good, rarely worth it, always punishing), but never one I actually wanted to kiss. I don’t know if I know how to do that.\\nSecond, I’m happy but I’m not an idiot. If this is actually a crush, nothing good is ever going to come out of it. No way no how.\\nThird, timing. I was going to die, by my hand, soon, and now I have a new lease on life. Can you imagine that my sudden change is because I like a boy? It would be so sad, and really dangerous, and again so very sad. And I’m fine now, but what if I start wallowing about it? I can’t afford that.\\nSo I’ve come to the conclusion that me having a crush on this dude is:\\n* Really gross.\\n* Potentially lethal (for me).\\n* Ugh.\\nAnd like I said, I truly don’t think I’m in denial. I honestly don’t know and I’ve come (as I write this) to the very reasonable conclusion that the answer better be “no”. And I can’t tell, I really can’t tell. Yes, I feel sort of funky when I hear about his relationships and crushes and romantic connections, but honestly that doesn’t tell me much because I’ve always felt bad when hearing about blossoming new romances and shit, because it brings out many of my own insecurities.\\nI guess this is it? Oh, man.\\nTL;DR: I have depression, anxiety and a few other stuff going on, I don’t really have the energy or motivation to try to do anything about that, was planning to kill myself soon and then one day out of the blue I felt a lot better. Didn’t like it, didn’t understand it, live in fear it’s going to go away and never come back, now I don’t understand my own emotions most of the time. Because of timing I’m afraid I might possibly have a crush and that’s why I feel better, because that would suck real bad.\", 'text_b': None, 'label': 1}, {'guid': 2042, 'text_a': 'Overthinking... : I’m 18(m) but I’m always told I’m mature for my age.

I've been a huge fan of games and movies since I was a little child and yeah I usually got what I wanted but that's not the point here. When I was 5 or 6 years old my mother met her new man and they started dating and so on. Soon after they started to date he was all over me not like in sexual manner but he used to hit me and keep my head underwater and lock me in sauna and even kept me from eating sometimes. And he always did these things when I did something that he thought was wrong like not  cleaning up my room, being late or if I didn't do any homeworks. And he even did it in front of my mom sometimes and she did nothing to prevent it they even had a kid and got married. Of course when my step brother was born i got blame for every little mistake that I made and If my brother fell over then I got the blame and I was hit by my stepfather. Only one who believed me when I told about this was my dad's aunt who was my best friend and who always had my back but she was really old like 80 but she was everything to me back then because I didn't have any friends and I have always been that lonely kid.\\nWhen I grew up my dad's aunt died and soon after my grandmother and those two were really important to me and I didn't even cry when they died because all that I felt was deep emptiness that I still feel to this day even though I don't want to admit it. It left a deep void in me that I have tried to fill up for years and sometimes it has worked and I have felt happy but soon after it has only gone downhill. After my ''real'' first relationship in 9th grade ended when she cheated on me and went with another one and soon after that I have always felt really not so good about myself and I even thought about killing myself because life just felt so worthless but then came this another girl who first understood me and tried to help me and she did for a while and so we ended up talking for many months before we started to date and that was the worst relationship that I had ever had because it involved a lot of arguments and she blamed me about everything and I reacted the wrong way and I cheated on her and it left me with so much guilt that after few months it told her about it and I wanted to break up and so after that I avoided relationships and pretty much any human contact for 6 months until a new girl came into my life and we dated for few months and we broke up because I was a real mess and after few months we decided to try again and everything was going on really good until my mental issues surfaced and they pretty much messed up everything.\\nWell few months I was diagnosed with depression and OCD and I sometimes i get these intrusive thoughts that makes me question everything in my life but mostly it focuses on my relationship. Like those thoughts range from ''You don't feel for her anymore'', ''You don't love her anymore'' to ''just end this relationship'' and it makes me question that do I have feelings for her still. Sometimes I get this feeling of deep emptiness and sometimes it comes when I am alone and when I am with her and it scares the hell out of me. Like I want to enjoy my life with her but my mind struggles so hard to make me feel like that I don't want to be with her anymore and sometimes it feels so real that I even start to believe it. I have told her about these and she has promised to help me in anyway that she can so she is very understanding. This is also concerning to me because we haven't had any problems in our relationship and soon we have dated for a year. She was my ex before but we broke up because I was acting like an asshole and she still had feelings towards her ex so we broke up but then I didn't know about it even though I asked her many times. And when we got back together she didn't tell me about it and I had to find out myself and I felt really bad because she lied to me back then but now everything has been fine in our relationship and we have both worked on those old issues and are no longer keeping secrets but I can't find out why I feel like this. Like is this because of my mental problems or is this relationship genuinely not good? Sometimes I feel like ending everything would be a good choice because then I wouldn't have to feel anything anymore and just be gone from everyones life.\", 'text_b': None, 'label': 1}, {'guid': 2046, 'text_a': 'What a horrible thing for a psychiatrist to say to someone with depression : I have terrible grammar but I will try to express this the best I can.\\nI have always had a difficult time in school, it\\'s like I lack the ability to study.

My mother and I always had a great relationship (as great as it can get hen you are only discussing school and leaving out every personal feeling and thought because you know your mom will never understand). It was obvious that I was their favorite; I was spoiled rotten. My relationship with my dad was loving and nice, but we never really talked. There was no depth. However, it was not like that with my mom. We talked about school and my friends, but I never felt comfortable talking about my personal life with her because she was incredibly judgmental. I kept a lot of things to myself, or I would share them with my sister. She is my best friend, and has always been kind of a second mom to me, something my mother was always jealous of. In all honesty, I, and much of my family members believe my mother has a mental illness (my sister and I have diagnosed her with being a sociopath after a lot of research and reminiscing), however she refuses to acknowledge it. All in all, my life was not perfect, but it was a good life filled with family and friends.\\xa0\\nI met my best friend in 6th grade, but we did not become true best friends until high school. We were inseparable; I was either at her house, or she at mine. We told each other everything, as best friends do. We even had similarly strict mothers, so we could relate to each other in that aspect. We always talked about living together when we went off to college, to get an apartment together to have our freedom, but we knew our mothers would never approve. So we planned in secret.\\nAs I said, my mother and I had a good relationship. I was always a good child. I was terrified of getting in trouble, and never disobeyed my parents. It was not until my senior year of high school that I could see our relationship changing for the worse. My mother became even more strict, nosey, and suspicious. I wanted my freedom, and she wanted nothing more than to keep me locked in our house with as little freedom as possible. The last thing she ever wanted was for me to have my own life and leave her and my dad. Needless to say, the older I got, the harder it was to live in that house.\\nIn 2011, I graduated from high school and began going to a community college in town, where I stayed for one year to start my basics. During this time, living at home was a nightmare. I was 19 and still had to ask permission to do anything and everything. I was miserable. Meanwhile, my bff and many of my other friends went straight to universities. I was young, impatient, and wanted to be like everyone else, so I transferred to the university in my town that next fall. My dad worked there at the time, so I got a huge discount on tuition as long as I maintained a certain GPA. As I have said, my mother is crazy and strict. Once I was attending, my mother was always in my school business. For some reason, she was under the impression that I had to show her my grades daily. She did not understand that college was not high school; we do not receive report cards, and my grades were just that—MY grades. I felt no obligation to show her or anyone else how I was doing in school. In all honesty, I was doing very poorly. I was not adjusting well to college and it showed in my grades. I was never one to disappoint my parents. I always tried my best in school and made decent grades, so this was all completely new to me. So, when my mom was constantly asking to see my grades and I refused, conflicts arose.\\xa0\\nLiving at home was harder than ever. I was trying to grow up and become my own person, while my mother was trying to keep me her baby for as long as she could; except she did it in the only way she knew how, which was to pick fights and push me away. We fought constantly about everything. She tried to take away my phone at times, but I paid for my phone bill so I refused. She went ballistic. Refusing to show her my grades set her off. She even wanted to know my login information, which I did not give to her and she hated it. I could not talk to my dad about any of this, because he always sided with my mom, or would just defend her. He never saw her in the same light as my siblings and I did--fearful, crazy, unstable, and unpredictable.\\nI was 20 by now, and finishing up my first semester at college. My grades were the worst I’ve ever had, and I knew my mom would be upset. Bff and I had been planning to move out together soon, except neither of us told our parents. I knew the conversation with my mom would not be civil, and bff's mom would just try to talk her out of it. My mom has a history of getting violent, both verbally, mentally, and physically. This is one of the reasons I tried to never disappoint or anger her. She never laid a finger on me (aside from spankings when I was younger), and in my mind I would never let her. I would never put up with abuse as she did to both my siblings. I had seen first hand what she was capable of, and that scared me. So, I came up with the best solution I could think of to protect myself.\\xa0\\nIt was now the end of the semester, and grades were posted. I was ashamed of how terrible I did and I knew my mom would want to see them when she got home. So, I packed a bag and I told my dad I was going out, and left. Before getting even a mile down the road my mom called me. She knew something was up—call it mother's intuition. I told her that I was leaving, that I could not do it anymore, and that I was sorry. She completely lost her mind, which I expected. In my mind I had two options; stay and tell her in person and risk getting hit (the risk was a 100% possibility), or do as I did. Eventually I got to my destination, a friend’s house, and I explained everything. I called my sister and told her everything, and unfortunately put her in the middle of it all. My mom was desperate to get me to come home, so eventually I agreed to meet her at my friends house. Before my friend got a chance to tell her mom our plan of moving out, my mom beat her to it and told her everything. This complicated everything more. We met at her house, and I was terrified of seeing my mom. I knew what was coming. Sure enough, when I denied going back home, she tried to hit me and shoved me into a bookshelf. I threatened to call the cops, and friends mom asked her to leave. In return she took my car and left me there. Everyone was in shock; there were no words to describe how we each felt. I eventually called my sister and she came to pick me up and took me home with her. That night was one of the longest of my life. I broke my parent’s heart, and they broke mine. That one decision, forever changed my life.\\xa0\\nMy friend and I were still in touch to move in together, however it was not for a month or so. For the next few months, I was considered homeless. I stayed with my sister, a friend I met at college, and a coworker from when I worked at Walmart. During all this time I only had the bag of stuff I took with me the night I left home. My mom refused to let me get my stuff, and in all honesty, I was terrified to go back and get it. During this time, I met my boyfriend. We were coworkers at Walmart, and he invited me to stay with him and his roommates during the holidays, which I accepted. We clicked and decided that when I moved into my apartment with my friend, he would move in too and help with the rent.\\xa0\\nOne day, bff and I were finally able to sign for a 6 month lease on a 2 bedroom apartment. The day came when we could finally move in, which my bf and I did. Neither of us had many belongings. He came from the dorms at college, and I came with my bag. I kept asking my friend when she was bringing her stuff, so she would bring little things over, like dishes or other impersonal items. I began getting the feeling that she was hiding something from me. Sure enough, I was right. One day, she texted me and told me how sorry she was, but that she would not be moving in with me and would continue to pay her half of the rent. Not only had I lost my relationship with my parents just months before, but I also lost my best friend. I was so upset at her for doing that to me, betraying me, and not even having the nerve to tell me in person but over a text. At this point the only people I had in my life was my sister, and my bf. My life kind of sucked.\\xa0\\nFor the next few years, my mom called me constantly, leaving me ugly voicemails, calling me every name in the book, and completely disowning me. My dad was hardly aware of the situation, and kept his distance; he never even reached out to me. In addition to disowning me, my mom also disowned my sister and her two kids, because she thought my sister helped me plan my moving out. To this day, my mom has never tried to make contact with my sister or her kids. In fact, those kids are terrified of her and hate her because of what she did to my sister and me.\\xa0my niece, who is know 13 actually has nightmares about my mom. \\nAbout 4-and-a-half years ago, my mom let my dad bring me my stuff. It was a truckload of my belongings, half of which she destroyed. I remember going through it with my sister, we pulled out a blanket that smelled like a combination of vomit and urine. I had to throw it out, as well as other items that were crushed or vandalized. I never got all of my stuff back, and I probably never will. I had never stepped foot in that house again until last year when I went to visit my dad. My mom was not home so I knew it was safe. We talked outside for a bit, and I asked to go inside. I wanted to see my old room. There were still some of my things in the closet and room, like my rock collection. I asked my dad if I could take it with me but he said no, because then my mother would know I was there and he wouldn’t want to upset her. I walked around the rest of the house, everything was the same as the last time I was there; they even still had our pictures up—which I thought was ridiculous. All of my old toys from when I was a child were packed away somewhere. My dad said maybe one day I can have them. I hope one day I can, because it stinks not having one thing from my childhood to see or hold, or give to my future kids.\\xa0\\nIt has been about 7 years now since everything happened, and I still cry for the relationship I will never have with my parents. I cry that I will never feel the embrace of my mom or dad again; that I will never hear them tell me “I love you” ever again; that they will never know their future grandchildren or son in law. It hurts me so deeply, but I know that nothing will ever be the same. I truly believe that my mom has an illness, and even if she were to seek out help, I would never be able to talk to her the way I used to again. I envy the people who have amazing parents, who love them unconditionally, the way a parent is supposed to love their child. I question everyday why I was not blessed with parents like that. Every time something bad happens in my life, I question if it is my karma for leaving the way I did and if that is what I deserve for hurting my parents. I cannot begin to imagine the pain and hurt I put my mother and father through, but I don’t think that is an excuse for their behavior or the way they treated my sister and I. I have spent many days and nights crying for that loss, and I hope that one day I can truly move past this, and be happy the way I once was knew how to be.\\xa0\", 'text_b': None, 'label': 1}, {'guid': 2052, 'text_a': \"Deciding about my future is so fucking difficult : I should chose a university I want to study at and apply there in 2 months.

I had Images from that time that ive builded as Example two towers connected by another and i also builded around that time out of lego complex stuff and i liked to help others, also the only other thing i remember was that ive had in a game 4 times a 6. Then i was going to an special school wich started with an 0th class (yep i know it sounds like bs but its not... actually its not lied but its bs) It was a smaller school wich i had an unbeliveable nice teacher, she even allowed us to ride once on her parents horses. Then our class had split up bec we were too less and a while after i was in the new class i switched to an normal school, i cant tell when exactly or why the school got closed some years later since it would give hints instandly to me. in the new school i was in a relation ship with a girl slided her pants down the list time we saw us, i know thesedays its thinking over sexualized but back in the time it was just doctorgames or something like that, also i tell it here since it will be relevant later on. In the new school i had 3 female friends, i often did hurt them at games like hidenseek but didnt understand that i did that, i was still lacking emphaty, they all remember me as an idiot, the teachers said i should think about my actions but i didnt know what thinking was. (also i should mention that it was like ive skipped a class since as example what we would do in the 3th class they do in the 2th, one more information is that i never learned the Abc or this other form of writing.)  \\nIn that time i had doctorgames with another girl but without touching, the next day she talked about everyone about it)  \\nAnd while that time i watched sience shows for 2 years, in that time i had my first depression since i started to think and to understood that our lifes are useless, i was also scared of the power of nature. Im not sure if it was here that my mom had a shop in another country with my aunt. i drove like every weekend and holiday for 2 years  there, on the way i first time learned to controll what i see, in your words imanigation, from that point on i done it like extremly often. around that time when i was out i had my first friend outside of the school, we were often in the forest doing shit, with my belgium cousin we played minecraft on a virus flooded laptop from me and yea life was simple for me.  \\nITS TIME TO LET THE SHIT GO DOWN\\nonce a battle over money came up and we litterally fleed with an other cousin wich lived at my aunt out of the country, we did hide our car somewhere and he broke multible windows and raced in a 50 zone with 130 and lost after that they his license for a while, we escaped to our home country. then my mom opened her own buisness. meanwhile i came in the 5th grade and had fun batteling with 11th graders in sience and i also learned that my brain is slowly advancing stupidly fast, a teacher gave me a long mathematic x=... and he just gave me one precalculated one, i remember that i didnt know what ( etc means but after 30min watching it i learned to calculate such equaltion , also in my head i could controll my dreams, i builded up a futurist world where everything is fine and the technologys i created over time in my head are real machines wich are innovative.) i didnt make really friends at that time, it didnt bother me. in 6/7th grade i had a social teacher helping me since i saw her as a mother at that time my head started to let me see memories like a video, my brain adapted to an pc analysing like vision, my math grades exploded, also i kept rooms i was in in my head and on the floor when light was off i could overdraw what i see with red lines and also i could manipulate my own memories (wich fucked me since im not sure if anything i tell here isnt a fucking manipulation) in that time i was often in illegal streams too to watch anime, once i got interested and just pressed on a ad with flat boobs, i keep doing that until i came to a page with pornhub at start and a link going my entire screen, it was my first contact with cp. To this day im sure that some people from pornhub host in normal net childporn but just hide it extremly well. Also WTF can a little kid find cp but not some fucking paid police officers.... Then it interested me, i didnt get hard or something, it was just sheer the new wich dragged me to get tor and seach stuff up and i did find it and i watched it a whole year, i wanted to know why people do such things and so on, it just interested me their motives, i know its terrible and im preparing already for the negative karma flood but yea, (watched reddit videos). then i skipped a class again. in my new class my grades exploded in the prositiv and i met a girl, the girl teached me emotions over time, in winter also i had a relation started with a girl wich i played often and we videochatted alot, she was a year younger then me, you need to know that i was fat at that time and some people really though im old, even tho i wasnt even 15... her brother forced us to stop contact. after that i was down and really sad. at that spring my head started to hurt a bit always and slowly i my ability to remember stuff got bad, when i overjumped i knew wich cloth everyone had to any day, i could give exact dialogs some days after so on. at that time i stopped the relation with my best and first real friend i had since he emotionally abused me. my parents splitted also up a year before and my mom moved to another man and left me and my brother together at a home, i was the one who said yes but yea, i also saw all the abuse from my parents aganist each other... even the blood on the floor. but back in the time now i also slept like 2-4 hrs everyday... i also stopped really learning new things ( men while i type this down i stopped and started alot of shit lol) she also teached me how to talk normal and not just in complicated words, funny thing is i can now just talk so and not complicated. i also took an iq test wich revealed that im very close to autism, my brain structure is different and the test were made in 4 catergory's, in one i had 78 point and in the highest i had 138, the docs told me they never seen such an difference, the highest they even knew before was 24. wich is extrem already, over years my grades got worse, my meorie system is fucked now, i can remembler like almost nothing, i cant learn anymore, i had 2 breakdowns, i figured out that my family dont cares about me, my brother emotionally abuses me, i cant learn anymore and i feel degenerating. i lost my vision my dream world wich always protected me, i have now friends and emphaty but the question is what do i do now?  \\nIm stuck, i want out of this life, i wanna develope the technologys in my head but how when noone belives me, i could have a trauma from the forced end relation from the other shit or from the time where an another aunt used a hammer to attack us with the aunt before to get somehow money, i stopped to belive in god a long time ago, im just lost, i want my memories back my old abilitys, i wanna find a way how to get out of this shit, i know i missed alot of informations but does anyone know what i have to do, i tried to give an text about whats wrong with me but im just not fine anymore. please help me, im lost my memories are gone im degenerating my mental health getting abused my family doesnt care about me.

I haven't felt too upbeat about life since high school and even when I like my life at points I just come crashing down mentally.\\nI tried booking an appointment with my GP but although he was sympathetic and pleasant he seemed to think my symptoms were mild depression and suggested I see the social worker in his office. I know social workers have some training but he didn't even mention how to book an appointment and never mentioned how to see a psychiatrist or psychologist or offered to give a referral. I'd prefer to just ask another doctor for a referral but I live in a country with crap public healthcare so it's tough to find another doctor and I don't know if a new would be any good. It took me weeks to build up the courage to book that appointment and it did little for me. It didn't help that I was doing well when I came in so I didn't describe the worst of my symptoms. Doesn't help that he didn't ask enough about it though.\\nAlso, If i wanted a referral to a specific psychiatrist how easy is that to get?? Could I just book an appointment saying I wanted it or how would that work? \\nIf I wanted an Aderrall or Ritalin prescription how could I get that? I was hoping to get one the last time I visited my GP specifically about having difficulty focusing and he just said it was probably mild depression.

I had a ton of fun chilling with friends, played some great videogames, got a 3.8 GPA in classes (yes, my GPA has gone UP during my depression), and began doing some really cool research with a nearby hospital. But beyond that, I wasn't doing anything. No college clubs, no scholarship/award/job applications, no extracurriculars.

Nah I\\'m just kidding. Instead you can call me Koid. Yea I know. I know that\\'s a weird ass name. Dont judge me. I suck at making up names. I dont have the imagination I once had when I was a kid so deal with it!\\n\\xa0\\xa0Well now that we have somewhat of an introduction to who the protagonist, the hero, the savior of this story is! (Me). You\\'re probably NOT asking yourself why am I reading this. So maybe you should ask yourself that. Did you ask yourself that yet? Yea? Ok good. Well my good reader that\\'s an easy answer. You read my title. I mean come on now. Isnt \"My Addiction to Pain\" a good ass tittle? DOES THAT NOT GRAB YOUR ATTENTION? Sorry sorry. I get carried away sometimes. But anyways that answer to your question should be answered later on. And only by you. I can\\'t answer that for you. I don\\'t know why you read random stuff online or if this goes big then from a book store I don\\'t know you! Sorry again. I don\\'t mean to yell.\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Well my friend. I want you to ask yourself this second question. What does this title mean to me? No, not you me. Koid. So what does it mean? Anyone? Really no one? Well fine then. I guess I\\'ll answer this myself. The title of this story means absolutely nothing to me. But at the same time absolutely everything. This title is the embodiment of my life. Hell, this title is my life. Hence the whole \"My\" in the title. This is a story of my struggles in life and what I had to overcome and what almost made me take my own life. This is the story of a man who has known nothing but pain for such a long time that he realized it was the only thing constant in his life. The only thing he knew to be true. He knew this feeling so well he fell in love with it. He fell in love with a feeling of dread, quilt, and despair. He fell head over heels for it and he didn\\'t even know it. But why does this mean nothing to me as well? Well my reader. From the good words of Thomas Shelby \"This addiction is in the past now. And the past is no longer my concern.\" Actually he doesn\\'t say it exactly like that but it\\'s close enough to the point where if someone who\\'s reading this saw the peaky blinders then they\\'ll know I totally ripped that off from the show and I don\\'t want to be used. So better to be safe than sorry.\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0And before I continue I want you to know something. I am not a writer. I suck at grammar, I probably won\\'t use the correct words or proper paragraph styles. I\\'m not an English teacher. Shit the last time I read a book to its entirety was back in highschool. And even then I used the fuck out of sparknotes to get through that class and at least have somewhat of an understanding of what I was reading. I\\'m about to turn 22 by the way at the time I\\'m writing this. So yeah. If there\\'s any english major\\'s reading this or teachers or just anyone who knows how to properly write a book or essay. Please bear with me.\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0I\\'m going to be honest with you guys also. I don\\'t know where to even begin. Do I start from the very beginning?\\xa0 Do I tell you guys how 2019 shaped up to be the worst year ever? Or do I tell you about my most recent relationship with my ex girlfriend? I don\\'t know yet. I\\'m just winging this here. But whatever I choose to begin with, I really hope you guys stick around for the ride. And possibly enjoy it? No, this is going to be a depressing tale, or maybe it won\\'t be. WHO KNOWS? But I do hope this helps whoever needs it. Whoever needs help to move forward in life like I am doing and understand why you\\'re doing what you are. Please enjoy.\\nCHAPTER 1: A Tale of Dead Romance\\xa0\\nSo here goes. My last relationship was way over before I even knew it. I was with this girl for quite some time and I didnt even know our relationship had already ended. What do I mean by that? Well, she and i were at a rough spot for a while. Constantly fighting constantly arguing over stupid things. But me being the idiot I was, I thought that was normal. You know?\\xa0 Like every relationship they show on TV or have people tell you, you\\'ll always argue with the significant other. That\\'s just life. That\\'s \"NORMAL\". But I was a fool when it came to this. I didnt know she and I had already drew our last breath in this relationship. I didnt know she had already moved on and found someone else. I dont blame her. I really dont. She and I had been in a tight spot for a while. Where she and I would argue almost every night over such stupid little things.\\xa0\\nIt\\'s funny to be honest. Looking back now. Those fights are kinda what I miss most now. Because with every compromise she and I made I knew she cared. Even if it was a little bit. Maybe I should have been more supportive on her endeavors. Maybe I should have been there for her. Maybe I should have continued to monitor the situation and adapt to her to keep her. These are the thoughts that keep up at night. These are the reasons why I dont sleep. Because I think about her every night. Right now it is March 8th 2020. We broke up on November 18th. On her birthday when I went to go and see her. Yet I lie here awake at night not able to sleep thinking about what we could have been doing right now. What we could have been talking about. What we could have been planning. Not a day has gone by where I haven\\'t thought about her…\\xa0\\nI promise you reader this has never ever been me. I was never one to be like this. Sure I\\'ve always been lonely. I\\'ve actually always liked being alone. To be in my own bubble. Away from society and family. Just on my own. But nowadays… while I still crave to be alone in my thoughts I get upset because I know theres no one thinking of me. I know that at night I wont be able to sleep with someone on the phone or have a night call with. You may be telling yourself \"well why dont you find someone else to do all those things with?\". It\\'s just not that simple. I got torn down when she and I broke up. I became someone I didnt even recognize anymore. When I look in the mirror I don\\'t even see myself anymore. I see a lost soul looking for something that is out of my grasp out of my understanding. Out of my comprehension of what I am feeling right now. Have you ever felt this pain? This suffering that all you want to do is get better but cant? That when you see a happy couple you cant help but imagine but to remember that\\'s how you used to feel like?

The theories presented are of my own creation and have not been tested in any way. \\nAs an individual struggling with depression, the search for happiness has gone hand in hand with a search for survival. Strugglers of serious depression spend their whole lives in search of happiness. Depression is a journey for happiness, unique to each individual. One main misconception about \"curing\" depression is that other people know how to guide you on your journey. Happiness doesn\\'t have a formula. Any doctor that claims to have a method for curing depression is a waste of your time.   \\nMany non depressed people hold individuals to societal standards and if individuals meet these standards and are depressed, people look at them and wonder why. I\\'m not an exception. I attend a prestigious university, am very financially support by very well off parent, have never had to worry about any basic human needs, have tons of friends, a girlfriend, and I\\'m doing well in school. But I also sat on my be also nightly with a knife to my wrist edging ever so close to choosing the easy way out. I cry myself to sleep every night out of self loathing and when I wake up, my first thought of the day is is this going to be my last day? \\nNaturally, given my well off parents, I received every treatment / therapy you could imagine in my quest to shake my depression. None of it had any effect. I continued down the path of following recommendations and such on the internet and from professionals; that path drove me deeper and deeper into depression. My depression got to the point where I wasn\\'t even sure if I liked my intermediate family anymore. One day, I snapped. I just left. Not for long, only about 6 hours, but in those 6 hours, I learned more about the way life works than I had in my previous 20 years.\\nIn those 6 hours I learned the most crucial lesson anyone could teach you: you know what\\'s best for you and you alone can best medicate your mind. When it comes to your physical health, it is best to leave it to the professionals. This is because anatomically, most bodies are the same. They are made up of the same stuff and operate virtually the same way regardless of the human. But this is the exact opposite for the brain. \\nEvery brain on planet earth is distinct and unique. I would describe the brain using the 90/10 theory. 90% of the human brain is a result of evolution. We all have the same survival instincts and similar traits that have resulted in humans arriving where they are today. This area of the brain allows us to converse, eat, sleep, and do everything \"normal humans\" do. Your 90% is what makes you human. However, it is the 10% of the brain where you find uniqueness among individuals. Your 10% is who you are, what separates you from other humans. Ideally, individuals will let their 10% loose and really express who they are. This is unfortunately very far from reality. As I have pointed out and will continue to, society isn\\'t good for the individual. Society is a competition for materialistic things in order to prove you are \"better\" than someone. Due to the competitive side that exists in the 90%, societal expectations take control over your 10%, hindering you from truly being you. More on the process of taking control of your 10% below.\\nI\\'m still developing my craft as a writer and couldn\\'t find a great way to transition to this paragraph, so here\\'s a really awkward and out of place sentence. Social classes have certain expectations within that class and you are considered a failure in some respects if you don\\'t meet these expectations. For the son of an upper class white male such as myself, the expectations look somewhat like this: go to college, graduate, get a job, make money, get married, have kids, retire early because you are wealthy. It didn\\'t occur to me until my sophomore year (I had been dealing with depression for multiple years at this point) of college \"what if I don\\'t want to meet these expectations?\" \\nFor some this is going to be a lot harder than for others. Accepting that you no longer want to fit into these societal expectations will often be met with judgment and criticism from the people you thought were your closest friends, sometimes even family. I understand more than most just trying to fit in in order to feel good about yourself, but I promise you that once you pursue what you are genuinely passionate and excited about, you won\\'t care about other peoples opinions of you. The people who truly care about you will stay by your side regardless of how you live your life.  \\nIt is my belief that depression is somewhat systematic, meaning the society we live in promotes unhealthy standards of living leading to an increase in depression in younger people. Take the risk to be your own person. Own your 10%.  \\nThe 3 big takeaways\\n* \"Good\" \"Happy\" \"Happiness\" are all relative terms. Just because something makes you happy, doesn\\'t mean it will make someone else happy.\\n* This one is more directed at parents. I understand that if the child is younger it is your responsibility to raise your kid as you see fit (I am not a parent and am in no way trying to give parenting advise). That being said, once your kid reaches around college age, as I have, they\\'re old enough to start formulating their own decisions. If your child has been depressed over the past couple of years and you play a big role in their life, as hard as it is to do, you need to step back and allow your kid to pursue what he/she wants to pursue, not what you want him/her to pursue or what you think he/she should pursue. I\\'m not saying step completely out of his/her life, but as your child matures, it is important to take more of an advisor type role. As tough as it might be to watch your kid fail, we need to learn from our mistakes and learn from them.\\n* You know what\\'s best for you. Don\\'t be afraid to pursue what you love to do. Own your 10%.\\nAgain, this letter is from personal experience and everything said does not necessarily apply to everyone, or anyone for that matter.

My mom called in the morning to say she was on the way. We were going down to her boyfriend\\'s. I was a big momma\\'s boy. Alright, so = Me and my friend are downstairs watching a movie, but I\\'m so anxious that I\\'ll miss her that I keep running upstairs to check for her car. It was taking way too long. You know, I\\'m getting worried. Then, the phone rings. It\\'s my mom. She tells me that they came, knocked, and waited, but no-one answered. She figured I decided that I didn\\'t want to go. So she wrote a note and had my sister put in on the door. I asked her to come back and pick me up, but you know, she couldn\\'t. It would have taken like an hour to get there and another hour to get back. At that point it\\'s too late to take the boat out, so you know, day ruined. Better if they just continue on and I stay with my friend. She promised to call when they were done.\\nHost: How pathetic\\nMe: It was dark by then. She wanted me to stay the night at my friend\\'s again because it was late, she was tired, and it was out of the way. I told her that I really wanted to come home. \\\\*Imitates mother\\\\* \"Fine.\" But hey, it wasn\\'t all bad. They did save me a slice of cake.\\nHost: \\\\*laughs\\\\* really?\\nMe: Yeah, it was pretty nice of them since her boyfriend had bought the cake. Didn\\'t have to give me any. Plus it would have been to hard to bring the whole thing.\\nHost: ...\\nMe: ...\\nHost: Go on\\nMe: Right. Birthday in the seventh grade, I thought I\\'d take a three hour round trip bus ride to my old neighborhood to see my old pal and only friend. I called beforehand. Right off the bat he warned I couldn\\'t stay the night. I said that was OK, secretly thinking that if I missed my bus he\\'d have to let me stay the night. He brought up that it was going to be late by the time I got there, I\\'d only have twenty minutes to hang out. I went anyway. It was more like five minutes. Heard the laughter as I walked back to the bus stop.\\nHost: Humiliating\\nMe: hmph. In the ninth grade my birthday fell on a Sunday and I was big into church. The youth ministers took me to buy church clothes. I was elated. After church they gave me a card with signatures and money.\\nHost: Boorrrng, yet still pathetic. Any other teenage boy would have hated getting church clothes for his birthday, but you... so starved for affection..\\nMe: In the tenth grade, my friend from the previous year (we\\'d moved again) called me to say happy birthday. He asked what I was doing. Which was nothing, of course, He invited me over. He said his mom had gotten a cake. She hadn\\'t.\\nHost: Oh, is this this the friend that was trying to hook up with yo-\\nMe: Yeah. That\\'s the one. Quick context - my gf, who had forgot my birthday entirely, would soon break up with me. I was obsessive, possessive, controlling, jealous, the whole stereotype. Well, once she ghosted me, I\\'d ask my friend if he had seen her, if he could tell her to call me, that I missed her, you know, the usual. He said he hadn\\'t seen her. Didn\\'t talk to her. Might say \"what\\'s up\" in the halls, but couldn\\'t remember. Well, years later I\\'d reconnect with my ex. Turns out he was trying to get in there the whole time. Told her that he wasn\\'t ever my friend, didn\\'t even like me.\\nHost: Ok, wrap it up champ.\\nMe: Young twenties birthday, I went to the casino. The dealer who logged me in saw the flashing birthday notification, he walked over to quietly say happy birthday. He asked what I was doing there on my birthday. I was embarrassed, I panicked.

Everyone has problems, your\\'s aren\\'t that bad. No wonder nobody likes you. So self centered.\\nAudience: \\\\*jeers\\\\*\\nHost: Agreed, Screw that guy.

I don\\'t advertise my birthday and nobody asks. It\\'s fantastic. I can avoid the shame and embarrassment. There aren\\'t weird looks when I explain that I do nothing on my birthday because work and shopping are my only social interactions. Shoot, I talk to myself more than I talk to others. Full on conversations.\\nHost: \\\\*laugs\\\\* coo-koo\\nMe: \\\\*laughs\\\\* No, not a back and forth, More like thinking out loud. I don\\'t want to know why I do it though.

But, how\\'d it go?\\nMe: Oh, the poor deceived soul.. on my birthday she took me on a full day of love. I mean, we did all the things she knew I liked.

I was happy, at least I think I was. I was confident, didn\\'t look like shit, had quite a few friends, lots of activities, a girlfriend that I lived with, didn\\'t have a high paying job but I liked the place. Life was great apart from my girlfriend cheating on me a couple of times - one time it was \"purely emotional cheating\", other time a \"drunk kiss\", nothing too bad, right? Easy to forgive and move on. Well... you still have to cry a lot, hear out a lot of apologies, \"make a decision\" which you\\'ve already made because you\\'re madly in love. But you have to at least pretend that you\\'re comprehending the whole situation and thinking about leaving her, so she knows the risk. In fact you\\'re not thinking about anything. You\\'ve already made your decision. Life is going to suck for several weeks, months, you\\'ll have some trust issues but you you\\'ll get through this, right? Right.\\nFor a while everything seems fine &amp; wonderful. Seems like everything\\'s back to normal, storm\\'s over. But it\\'s different, weather is not so sunny like it used to. You still feel loved and you still love her but this stuff is still lingering in the back of your mind. You can hide it under your smile, under love and passion. But it\\'s there. And it eats you from the inside whenever you\\'re alone with your thoughts.\\nUntil you get another hit right in your face. This one is different, this time you aren\\'t the one who makes a decision. She is. And now she\\'s playing this \"I gotta think about everything\", \"let\\'s have a break\" game. She\\'s already made her decision, there\\'s nothing you can do and you know it. And deep down you know that her decision is the right one. You have to get rid of the trash one day, it\\'s been piling up for 5 years. But it still makes you feel dreaded &amp; hurt, it\\'s been 5 years after all. 5 fucking years.\\nIt\\'s been 2+ years since all of this happened and now I think that this emotional mess was still better than my life now. I miss her, I miss having someone besides me, even if the love is \"fake\", even if something is happening behind your back. I miss hugging someone at the end of a stressful day, I miss feeling safe, even if this feeling is just an illusion. Life has changed a lot during these 2 years - I made an incredible career, I\\'ve lost some friends but I still have a couple, tried dating and I wasn\\'t too successful. I gained some weight (not obese in any way, just overweight), lost all of my confidence, now I\\'m not as extroverted as I used to be, I\\'m still assertive &amp; confident in my work environment (which contributed greatly in my career) but I\\'m pretty shy in any other social environment, I started smoking and I really hate who I am now.\\nAnd I\\'m trying to change it. I started going to the gym, didn\\'t stick to the schedule at first. I relied on my gym-buddy too much probably, didn\\'t want to go alone. Started over after a break of 5 months, going alone now and I really started liking it. Well apart from feeling lonely all the time. Either way, COVID-19 comes, town\\'s in quarantine, gym is closed. Always getting into some kind of obstacle. At least this obstacle is the real one.\\nEither way, during these 2+ years (maybe even 3 years), I was feeling worse and worse each day. The life seems to go nowhere. I have nothing and no one and I honestly don\\'t even believe that it\\'s going to change. I\\'m staying alone most of the time, I want to do something, I want to have friends, to be between people. I want to find new hobbies, new activities, be more positive, outgoing, confident. It seems to be so easy to everyone but not for me. I occasionally see people having first dates in a restaurants, couples going through the aisle of the supermarket while holding each other\\'s hands. I miss those things. I miss my old self. Nobody likes my current self, even I don\\'t. And I probably can\\'t even expect other people to like me.\\nBut one day, quite recently, I woke up in the morning feeling... different. For the first time in 2-3 years I had a positive outlook, I felt confident. It seemed like it\\'s all going to be well for me. It was like jumping from one really cloudy &amp; sad universe to the one that\\'s sunny. Needless to say, it didn\\'t last longer than a day. If it lasted longer, I wouldn\\'t be writing this terrible post here...\\nI don\\'t know what to do. I don\\'t know how to change. I don\\'t know how to find these bits of \"old me\" in my brain.

When we broke up, her new guy wasn\\'t the best looking guy in the world and now he has posted pictures from the gym where he\\'s fucking ripped. He progressed forward with his life and now I look at myself in a hypothetical mirror. And I\\'m still depressed piece of shit, stuck in time since 2 years ago. Will something change? Or I\\'ll have to live miserably for god knows how many years, still being stuck in 2018 when my life took a 180 degree turn? Or maybe I\\'m making the progress?

It started with very hurtful verbal abuse (calling me racist names, calling me worthless/a retard for asking questions etc) from people my own rank all the way up to the my warrant officer. Soon verbal turn physical and yes sexual. I wasn\\'t raped but I will not relive those memories for this post neither. Things carried on like that for what seemed like an eternity, i pretty much was forced out only 2 years into my dream of a long military career after 3 failed suicide attempts and an alcohol incident.\\nWhen I first came back I had a horrible time readjusting back to my former life. I was literally 100 pounds over weight (and the weight that I was when I entered boot camp at). I was back living with my parents which felt embarrassing and and overkill already to my already low sense of worth. I tried so reach out to everyone that I could to try to hang out with or talk but thi is always felt awkward  or in some cases I would be thirstier than a dying guy baking in the desert for months and immediately ruin the conversation and any chance of friendship.  I was so desperate for a normal sense of a relationship I fell quickly into a very toxic relationship ( I was a major contributor to the toxicity along with her some of her actions) 2 years later she ended up leaving me and i don\\'t blame her one bit. I was extremely clingy and jealous. Since I was not treating any of my symptoms of depression and anxiety I would have days where I would literally sleep all day even at her place.... which was another thing....\\nWhen I first came back I had a horrible habit of never sleeping at night because again I was not treating my PTSD  or sleeping for days like a bear in hibernation. So when I was dating her I was always at her place. On my fridays I would pack some things in a backpack and no joke as if I was a kid going to sleep over his friend\\'s house on the weekends. I would go to her place and sleep over then go back to my parents place as I worked and continue the cycle. I would have mental breakdowns at home too. I would have night terrors and periods where I would cut/burn myself leaving a couple of horrible scars on my chest/shoulder and forehead. \\nAnyways things got a little better after I went on an absolute social purge and deleted my facebook and stopped replying to the little people who texted me. I left that job and actually started to address my severe depression and anxiety along with my weight issue as well. I went to the doctors and college. I tried to amend my very damaged relationship I had with my parents and sister. I sought the right treatment which lead me to a 6 year recovery period where I lost  60 pounds and try to practice healthy habits. I quit drinking alcohol and smoking cigarettes. I now wake up to ride my stationary bike for 2-3 hours a day or go for very long walks. I currently work full time at a job that I actually enjoy. I even have my own unit in a apartment building but the only hang up is that I have an extremely hard time meeting new people or even talking to people\\nIt feels like I have all these skills to maintain myself so I avoid those cycles of depression and suicidal thoughts but gained no social skills at all. I freeze up and all those self defeating and self doubtfulness/loathing thoughts come washing over my like a tsunami. Therefore I tend to avoid crowds and gatherings.\\n_____________________________________________________\\nThe issue:\\n My problem is that I feel like a stranger in a town I literally spent the most amount of my life in.  I have no friends at all and the loneliness has been fueling my recent growing depression. I feel as if years of work is slowly unraveling itself. I\\'ve tried apps (pof tinder etc) and what not but honestly I was quickly discouraged when I literally had no replies other than bots and escorts. I\\'m left a sense of hopelessness even at someone somewhat young. I feel like my twenties has been a waste and trying to be the lone wolf in life is turning out to be something I don\\'t want. I just want to find genuine people to hang out with and talk to. I have no idea where to start. I could really use some help rebuilding a social life and honestly find someone special... \\nAgain sorry if the post is too long or whatever I just really needed to vent. Maybe my expectations are too much for myself and I should be satisfied with just being here at the present moment but the loneliness really is starting to a sink hole that I\\'m finding it to be harder and harder to climb out of...\\nTL;DR-  Military veteran with PTSD/Major Depression/Anxiety and absolutely no social skills in desperate need of help in relationship building.', 'text_b': None, 'label': 0}, {'guid': 2943, 'text_a': 'What do I do about my shitty ass fucking life? : I have basically no social life.

I started homeschooling a little before  this point.

By the end of it i couldn\\'t walk without crying.   \\n2017------  \\nI went through 8 blood tests plenty of mri\\'s some with radiation some without and it they came down to....absolutely nothing. they never found out what was wrong with me and after 6 months of physical therapy they stopped and never fixed my problem....my pain tolerance grew but every step i take hurts to this day. But lets back track a bit to the first week of 2017, one morning my dad came home and he was silent which was alerting. My mother and I were both in her bed together drawing and resting and he told me that my beloved grandmother died and just 30 minutes later my mom would go in for a blood draw and biopsy. So my siblings and i sat in the car well we waited for my mom and dad to come back out of the hospital, i didn\\'t know for a week or two more but my mother breast cancer and had a surgical removal later in the year. Thats all my trauma for 2017.   \\n2018------  \\nThis year I had depression and 3 different eating disorders but i met the most important person in my life and one of my best friends who we\\'ll call thomas, she has helped me beyond believe will all my mental health issues and its probably the only reason i\\'m around.

They started yelling more at me for not cleaning the entire house or doing everything their list said to do. but i got through it.  my parents seperated me from my friend but after a little time I tracked her back down on the internet and were still really close.  \\n2019------  \\nAt the start of this year i met this guy he seemed really nice and we were together for 4 months before he tried to use me. He tried forcing me into sexual situations and it got really out of hand so i kept my mouth shut and broke up with him. My parents started yelling more at me and my father even called me a fuck up and failure. By the end of the year i was ready to enter the dating pool again and i met this new guy and when shit started to fall apart i realized how wrong i was about him after i found out he was cheating on me with 3 other girls. my best friend of 8 years moved away because her parents couldn\\'t finance the area anymore  \\n2020---   \\nthis year i was just so destined to live better but my life doesn\\'t operate like that. my parents started taking trips for a couple days and its always so hard when they get back but this was the worst moment of my life. my sister was having trouble sleeping and then he yelled at her and my parents got into a fight and my dad hit my mom.

I suffer from severe depression and I realized that I wanted to be around the family and help her out, spoil and take care of my niece etc. \\nDuring my planning to move back, my father offered me a job working for his construction company building, flipping and repairing houses.\\nI was pretty reluctant as my father and I don\\'t have good history. But I did figure it would help me get settled in. I also was looking for a place to rent and was talking to my mother about a few places around the town. My father then suggested that I move into one of the houses that they haven\\'t started on yet and wouldn\\'t be working on for a year. He wanted me to work on the house in my spare time while also watching after the place to make sure that no one broke into it since they were storing tools and materials in the house. \\nAfter thinking about it I decided to take him up on his offer and so I moved across the country and into the house. Set up my bed and unpacked the basic essentials. I decided to keep the rest of my stuff in the boxes as I didn\\'t want to get dust on anything and because I was planing to move into another place during the summer. \\nSo I worked for my father and after the first payday he lets me know that his credit card info was stolen and someone took over $90,000. He says he can pay everyone but one person till he gets his insurance for the card taken care of, which should be done next week. He asked if he could just add the money on to my next pay check and would put it in the bank account. I\\'m thinking that I\\'m not hurting for money since I saved up for the move and had money in the bank for a few months. So I said \"Yeah that\\'s fine\". It\\'s family right...\\nSo next pay check rolls around and no money gets deposited into my account. My father is across country taking care of business for a few days, I can\\'t get a hold of him. I had worked a lot of over time helping him. \\nAfter he flew back I went over to my parents house in the morning for breakfast and to talk with him. My mother was sitting down as I was grabbing some pancakes and I mention to him that I haven\\'t been paid yet. My mom looked dumb founded and said \"you haven\\'t been paid?\". She looked at my father giving him a look. She figured I was being paid. He then said \"I can\\'t afford to pay you at the moment\". I asked him \"what do you mean you can\\'t pay me, you said you would be putting the money in my account\". My mom then replied, \"I think you should stop working for him till he pays you\". I then said alright and finished eating before going back to the house that I was staying at and started looking for another job. \\nMy father stopped by the house later that afternoon and talked with me. He told me that I need to find another place to stay, I figured he wasn\\'t happy that I mentioned he hadn\\'t paid me in front of my mother and that she had talked to him. So I found a place to stay that night and brought some boxes over. Since I wouldn\\'t be able to use the haul trailer till the weekend was over I left my bed and other stuff at the house. \\nEarly the next morning I headed over to the house to grab some more boxes and I notice a truck in the yard. I went inside the house and their was a stranger sleeping in my bed, using some of my stuff. I recognized him and he recognized me as we met along time ago. He was a old friend of my dads that worked with him at the mine decades ago. He got up and started talking to me over some coffee. He mention that he came back in town yesterday for a funeral and ran into my father. My Father then offered him a place at the house yesterday morning. He didn\\'t know it was my bed as my father didn\\'t mention it to him. He also mention that my father gave my money to my brother cause my brother was going through bankruptcy and need some extra cash to support the 5 kids. \\nSo that\\'s it. Turns out my father kicked me out to give my bed to a old friend of his. Gave $5500 that he owed me to my brother. I later talked to my mother and she said that none of their info for any of their credit cards were ever stolen so he lied to me too. \\nSo I\\'m out $5500.

WOOOOOSHHH!!). \\nAnd don't get me started on the corona thing T\\\\_T (don't worry, I got myself started anyway, this is a weird statement why do people make this.. why am I doing it?!) ... anyhow, all those damn idiots hoarding food and toilet paper, my boyfriend finally managed to find some toilet paper today and some dried red lentils (which is one of our staple foods) and it stresses me out so much.. and I worry one of these days we're going to be out of something and we have very little, we've been very low on money these past few months especially (we've never had a lot to spare anyway) and I'm always craving comfort foods and stuff that I can't have and to then run out of basic things is really unpleasant :( \\nAlso I just moved from Scotland (my boyfriend and I moved there initially and I was super hopeful and he got a cool job but then he quit and we quickly ran into money problems again and now we had to go back again because things weren't working out and blablabla) and my friends, the only real friends I've made in YEARS, are now all far away.. Two of them are still in the UK (one was going to India but now she couldn't because of virus stuff) and the other is somewhere super remote in Norway (good for him though, I think) and I really miss them every day and I'm not on any social media, I don't have a phone, I only use email (I just recently started posting here on Reddit out of sheer desperation, hi...) to talk to my mom (I don't call my parents cus I rrrrrreeeeaaaally hate phones and especially talking on a phone) so I've been extra lonely.. my boyfriend has to work a lot, especially now because co-workers are getting sick and taking extra measures not to infect people.. because he works with sick kids and nobody can risk infecting them which is another worry of mine! I'm so scared he's gonna catch the virus from some random person in the supermarket or something and then spread it to the kids without knowing it and they could die from it and I honestly don't know if I could live with that..\\nOn the bright side, he won't get it from me.. I haven't left the house in weeks, months(?) I don't even know.. I went outside with him, a few weeks ago, to go to the stores.. and I think we went for a walk in the woods once.. Today I stood out in the garden for a few minutes.. but sometimes I get so nervous or scared or both for no good reason that I don't even like being near the windows where people could possibly see me. \\nI'm turning 31 next month... I thought my last birthday was somewhat of a miracle because I used to say I wouldn't make it past 30.. But also.. we arrived in Scotland on my birthday (I even had cake, yay!) and I was so hopeful and optimistic about everything.. Before we left I made some good changes, I was eating well, lifting weights, I was growing my hair and my beard (yeah, I'm a boy, lemme know if I surprised you, cus that might make me smile) both of which were very bushy and full and then I got sick, a week (maybe two at most) after we arrived and was stuck in bed for a whole week or something and it was awful and I fell back into my old habits soon after that. It all went downhill from there. I shaved my beard because it became very annoying while I was sick and struggled to eat, later that year I also cut my long hair after my boyfriend's mother commented on my grey hairs (why do people insist on pointing that out?!) and while I used the excuse of ''I wanted to try short hair'' and told everyone that I would have regretted not cutting it also (which is partly true).. I miss my long hair so much.. it was almost at the longest length I've had before and I really wanted to go beyond that.. \\nAnother random annoying thing; my twitchy eye has returned, it started a few years ago and came and went, but it's back now and it really bugs me.. always my right eye, feels like it's the lower right corner but I'm not entirely sure (haven't really bothered looking in the mirror, cus I don't like looking in the mirror half the time ofc).. \\nAnyhow, I gotta eat dinner now and this is probably not a ''little'' rant and I might delete it or whatever later if that's possible.. but I expect it to be buried below the other posts and that's fine with me.. honestly, even if people comment (hi again), what exactly is that going to do for me? I'm too much of a hermit, maybe I'll leave it on as a form of exposure therapy.\", 'text_b': None, 'label': 0}, {'guid': 3159, 'text_a': \"Does any one else only watch/read fantasy because watching everyday situations makes you feel shit? : Basically fantasy and Sci fi books, TV and games are my only escape.

me, other personal thoughts / experiences i have, etc : for example, how is one supposed to differentiate \"episodes\" of mania / hypomania states from depressive states as a distinct problem vs having highs and lows caused by other things such as ritualistic coping mechanisms that influence personality? like if the way someone functions is relatively stable, hence in relation to having a \"personality disorder\", then how is one supposed to make a qualitative distinction between how someone with bipolar disorder should behave like / think like / function like who doesn\\'t have a personality disorder vs someone who doesn\\'t have bipolar disorder but does have a Personality vs someone who has both ( let\\'s just say ). \\nas someone who ISN\\'T diagnosed with bipolar disorder of any type ( instead have schizotypal personality disorder and major depression), but whom has met and been around many people who have had it for many years, probably the majority of them being the case in mental health groups, what i never seem to understand is this whole state dependent thing. like you either randomly become manic / hypomanic or you become \"Depressed\". it\\'s as if environmental issues / other factors don\\'t play a significant role or don\\'t need to at all, and it\\'s simply a come and go thing that\\'s 100 percent biological. it\\'s often very evident in the way they talk, like when i am in a depressive \"State\", it\\'s difficult to do things, and if i\\'m in a manic state, we\\'ll i\\'m doing things in stereotypical manners...\\nand a lot of people could say, we\\'ll, it\\'s like the whole spectrum way of looking at things, and that it only becomes a disorder if there is enough symptoms or impairment to start being considered one, but that\\'s a problem, because it doesn\\'t look at WHY the person is the way they are and it\\'s assuming that what the person is expressing or functioning like is the same thing as another. \\noften when i\\'d go to the DBSA groups, they\\'d use a scale, and eventually i became tired of giving a number, because neither numbers would fit my types of problems. if i said i was a low enough number, it would suggest that i should be in the hospital ( i had to clarify a more specific number to indicate what would be more \"Realistic\" when really the bipolar scale just wasn\\'t applicable to me ), and if i suggested something in the high range, it would suggest that i am manic or have some form of mania, when it\\'s not. so much an issue, that i\\'d be concerned about other people suggesting me to go take of my mental health first, because they\\'re too dumb to realize anything more complex. for example, agitation / anxiety / irritability / or restlesness would be considered as leaning towards mania, yet when you look at many research, it shows that those with unipolar depression can have all these issues, but that doesn\\'t make them have any sort of bipolar disorder...., you know, agitated depression would be an example. \\nnow this is just my personal observation / opinion, but i feel like bipolar disorder is a combination of biological and personality caused condition, where it can only occur in certain people with certain personality / psychological traits and biological influences. the reason why i say this is because pretty much everyone i\\'d meet or seen, as well as what research has shown about these individuals, as well as observing the nature of the condition itself, has shown that the type of problem in bipolar disorder is more specific to certain types of people with certain types of genes. and so what i\\'m trying to say is that it wouldn\\'t be correct or logical to just say that everyone can develop disorder, regardless of personality and genetic associations, and neither would it make sense for many other disorders. \\nand so it\\'s really irritating when people just wan\\'t to generalize or give a statement such as we\\'ll, just because your experience was like that, doesn\\'t mean it can\\'t be like this. like they aren\\'t actually factoring in what i said and coming up with an explanation that could provide some kind of reasoning that would answer my question in a more careful conscientious manner. \\nlike you could say, hmm..., that\\'s a good point, i\\'m not sure, i guess it could be like this or that..., \\nbut the thing is, from all these bipolar people i met and talked to, both in person and online, it was not like that at all, and that was with most of them being medicated too...., \\nand i never found someone who was different than the big 5 research either or MBTI faceats in relation to bipolar related disorders, including schizoaffective disorder bipolar type. all of them were either N\\'s / Ps and / or low on conscientiousness + high openness to experience, either low or high on agreeableness, low or high on extroversion, ( high on \"neuroticism\" ).  \\nalso as a random inference, what i noticed is that borderline PD co-occurred in a large proportion of these bipolar disordered people, and i didn\\'t find that surprising because the same has been shown in other \"Research\", and many of these people, if not majority of them i should say benefit well from the same types of treatments of \"typical\" people. like if they were qualitatively differently functioning people that much, they wouldn\\'t be benefiting so well or have such good outcome, particularly in the same domains of \"typical\" people, yet they do and my experiences with them were more or less similar. their personalities although not all the same were more alike than different. \\ni use to think i had borderline PD before i was diagnosed with schizotypal PD, until i realized i\\'m not like those who actually are diagnosed with borderline PD at all, and i don\\'t even wan\\'t to associate myself with them either. but then again, i don\\'t relate to the majority of people with schizotypal PD either, so much that i don\\'t think i even have schizotypal PD. it seems like the only logical solution would be Personality disorder NOS, but who\\'s gonna get support for that? \\ni have tried raising similar questions and viewpoints in various threads, reddit, psychforums, mentalhealthforums, and other places, but i just don\\'t have anyone else who shares the same experiences as me or thinks / functions the same way, and even if they do, we\\'ll they unfortunately suffer more \"silently\" and are not as visibly discernible, but i know that wouldn\\'t be true, because if they really were like me, i\\'d bump into more of them making the same types of points. you know, i rarely give casual generalized responses. my hope is to find a personality disorder support group in person that isn\\'t focused on borderline PD, since the only ones out there largely focus on those who have Borderline PD, which again, i see them closer to those with bipolar disorder than those with actual personality disorders...., but i guess my definition is a bit broad. i will say that i never met someone who had vulnerable narcissism or paranoid PD. i mean,  tons of people with paranoid schizophrenia but disorders that had paranoia in terms of relating to their personality, nada...., and even if i did, they weren\\'t like me, and their paranoia was more or less the same type found in schizophrenia.', 'text_b': None,

I’m homeless due to escaping an abusive and toxic environment. I sleep in my car and live out of a storage unit. At first, it was terrible. I was discouraged, scared, angry, all the emotions poured through my body. My first night in my car I ended up in the hospital with an extreme panic attack. As time has gone on, I’ve learned how to adjust, what places are homeless-friendly and what ones are not. I see homelessness with new eyes. I still wish that it wasn’t something that is looked so down on and that homeless people were not seen as “in the way” something that takes up space in society. Many homeless people have no shelter and live on the streets. Many have mental illnesses and can not afford medication to help them, so to others, they seem dirty and crazed. I’m lucky to have my car for my shelter. I have a support system of friends that I met at work that have quickly become family. I have my church family and a few individuals that I met when I first moved here. Things could always be worse. But in a sense, I feel very free. It is still hard, but I feel safer in most ways now than I did when I was in the environment I escaped from.

I’ve had clinical depression for the past couple years now and I think everyone can relate the the feeling of hopelessness. Thinking “if things were like this I would feel better”. “If only.....”. “I would be so much happier if ....”. But you end up thinking yourself in hole of sadness and feeling like there’s nothing you can do to fix it and the cycle repeats and nothing changes.\\nThis is how I mainly experience my depression. And lately I’ve been making changes in my life that’s been helping me and I hope this can help someone of you find a way to not get rid of your depression, but cope with it and find a way to tackle it everyday.\\nWarning: this is what I do personally to help me. I’m not saying this is the right way for everyone but I encourage you to try some of the ways I handle day to day life.\\n1) Most important of all: Get out of bed. \\nJust get out. Say to yourself 1, 2, 3, and stand up on 3. There’s something you can be doing besides laying in bed. I have to tell myself everyday no matter how much I want to sit in bed and do nothing and just sleep and not think about my problems, I know I can’t because I won’t be happy that way. There’s something you could be doing to make your day seem productive and like you got something accomplished for that day. Do laundry. Go for a run. Clean the dishes. Read a book. Do that one thing you’ve been putting off but won’t even take that long to do. The high you can get from having a fulfilling day feeling like you’ve been productive and done something is incomparable to anything I’ve ever experienced\\n2) Talk to someone. \\nNo matter how much you want to be reclusive and just keep to yourself I can not express how important having social bonds and commuting with others is. I don’t care if you don’t have friends, most of us really don’t. Literally talk to your coworker. Strike up a convo with someone in the grocery line waiting to checkout. Hell have a conversation with your Uber driver. Communication and expressing thoughts are such an important part of mental health and talking to people always makes me feel like none of us are truly alone in this world, we are all part of a collective group just trying to get through together.\\n3)Remind yourself everyday that you are worthy. \\nThis is the hardest thing I struggle with. When good things happen to me instead of feeling happy I feel sad. “I don’t deserve this” “I’m not suppose to feel happy” “I’m not worthy of this”. You are worthy. You are worthy of living. You are worthy of love. You are worthy of attention. You’re not the useless piece of shit you think you are. We all deserve happiness. This is essential to live a fulfilling life.

Since september of 2019 to be precise. \\nThe attending doctor complimented my italian surprised I had been for such a short time only in italy  but as I said I'd been watching italian tv since I was a kid and it could be the reason the very handsome nurse guy commented that italian is a very wide spread language in X(my country) and the doctor laughed about it . \\nNow here comes the fuck up which I never meant to say but I said and as many times I reply the scene I regret saying it. \\nSo basically the doctor asked if this was my very first time donating blood or my first time in italy. I explained that I'd never done a donation in X because I was scared . Now the doc was very curious and a bit surprised as to why and I said that hospitals there are not very sanitary and its kind of a common fear to not donate blood . \\nIn fact this is the idea my PARENTS have and I by no means think that way. I've always wanted to do a donation but my mom and dad forbid it saying it was dangerous and I could contract a decease if I went to a hospital to do so in X.\\n But somehow I ended up saying what my parents think instead of my true beliefs and  I feel bad for putting my country down like that feeling like I am in italy to escape a scary place. I'm here because the economy on X is even worst than italy.

But I am unable to convince my subconscious of this. Yesterday, and honestly a lot of the days prior because I need to remind myself how blessed I am or this will happen faster, I was raving about how great my current situation is. I was viewing things from the perspective of how great things are and how much I have to look forward to. But instantaneously those feelings flipped on me today. I only have some semblance of an idea of what triggered this. I was listening to a podcast and they were discussing things they would like to do this summer.  I guess I couldn\\'t handle the idea of somebody doing something I would miss out on, and I began to feel I had no way of keeping up. I want things to come to me effortlessly. I don\\'t take into account that these people are at an entirely different stage of life than I am either. When a depressive mood sets in for me, I am unable to comprehend time. I no longer have the ability to understand that I can do so many things in my life because I\\'m only 23 and I have so much time to accomplish all of these things. But I guess the \"I am only__ years old thing\" is starting to wear on me. I have only been getting older when saying it without much to show for it. (Of course this isn\\'t true, it\\'s just the way I inexplicably feel). So when I start to think about the fact that I want to travel, or I want to make more friends, have more dates, whatever the case I begin to feel sad. I tell myself all the things that are holding me back from doing so. In my mind, I hate everyone and this is why I can\\'t do this, I have dogs so I can\\'t travel or really leave the house much, and finally it\\'s because I am broke. Aside from me hating everyone, which is a deeper darker thing, the other two things just aren\\'t true. So I really have no idea why I believe them. From this point, I began to nitpick every little thing about my life. Everything that I don\\'t yet have that I feel for whatever reason I deserve. Everything that I have gone through that I feel is a negative is now amplified by 100 in my head. It began to eat away at me. I would like to have the opportunity to travel, I would like to have the opportunity to put myself first, I would like the opportunity to live a full life. This leads me down the rabbit hole of finding an issue with every single thing that exists in my life. Suddenly I wish the dogs weren\\'t \"such a burden on me that I could travel\" though I know this isn\\'t true and there are dozens of ways I could travel despite being a dog owner. I also love them more than anything in the world and I absolutely hate when I use them as a crutch to something that I don\\'t do. I start to be unable to control my emotions and lash out verbally at them and anyone else around me. Which is a trait I gained from my dad and I absolutely hate. I usually am able to recognize it and today I was, and it\\'s usually reminds me that I need to write it out and try to overcome. But when I try to write it out, I find myself getting stuck. I start to feel like I am being disengenuous with myself, and then I get confused about the way I truly feel about things.  \\nliterally all of the things that I am depressed about, I was finding reasons to be grateful for just days prior. But, Suddenly my current living situation isn\\'t enough, and I need to go shop for furniture and decoration and then my funds aren\\'t enough and I need to be responsible and I\\'m such a piece of shit for being so materialistic. Then my body isn\\'t good enough and all the work I\\'m putting in, in the gym is for nothing and I\\'m wasting my time. Then I\\'m just lonely and I need people around me but \"the universe isn\\'t putting the right people in my life\". The hardest part is knowing that all of this is nonsense and on my good days I can poke holes in all of it. Unfortunately this isn\\'t one of those days and all of those things seem valid to me even as I type.  \\nAnyway, sorry if I couldn\\'t condense it in a way that made a lot of sense.

It\\'s such a terrible thing. I makes tons of people kill themselves, sometimes without a reason. I had and still have depression. I know what it feels like or the general feeling of it. For me, it came out of nowhere. Maybe not nowhere but I dont know what caused it exactly. I can just guess maybe it was because I moved to a new state and am not a socialable person, so I just felt lonely or what. Or maybe it was because of my \"dad.\" I honestly dont know, but I\\'m not here to talk about how I got my depression I\\'m hear to explain what it\\'s done to me and many others. Some of the people I look up to have had depression like Suga (BTS) and Sultan Sketches. And mainly that\\'s that reason I look up to them. They have lived through it and I hope I can to. Now a few days ago I broke. I cried and I seriously thought about killing myself. I\\'ve been better since then but still because of depression my personality got more conserved and shy. I mean I was shy before but never this shy. I avoid talking to people because I\\'m afraid I might do something they dont like or intrude on them. Like I dont want to make other people feel like being around me is a chore for them, so I just dont talk to others. I mean if I say something, I might offend them or just get to close to them just to be a third wheel. Trust me I\\'ve been the third wheel of many many friend groups. I would just be in the back following them and listening to them as they talk, but never saying anything. I have had some friends that I really connected with. Those great friends should be enough for me especially when I have such loving aunts, uncles, grandparents, and parents. But I still feel so lonely. I feel like I cant tell anyone about my depression because it would only burden them. You see I cant talk about other people\\'s depression, but mine literally tells me I\\'m inferior to everyone, I dont deserve anything, and I\\'m always bothering others. This means I think thoughts about how this other girl is smarter than me and another person in nice than me. I want to die, but dont deserve that. So, I shouldn\\'t pass on my sins to others and be peaceful when I\\'m dead, while they suffer. I dont deserve the peace. Lastly, the bothering others one means I dont talk to others because they dont like talking to me, I dont ask for help because that means I\\'m taking up someone\\'s valuable time forcing them to help me out of kindness, pity, or just to help out their persona.

It also made me lazy (*lazier) by not giving me the will to do other things, helps (not a good thing) me procrastinate more because honestly I just want to go back to watching that amazing anime (I have an anime watched list. Dont judge) so I can be happier and forget about my problems. I\\'m such a coward, running away from my depression instead of facing it head on.

My whole life people have perceived me as the funny, goofy extrovert. To be fair it’s a role I’ve given to myself, growing up I would always try to dismiss anything I found negative with a joke. Being the funny one allowed me to hide from reality and kept me happy. This worked fine throughout elementary school and made me a pretty happy kid, yet in middle school things started taking a turn for the worse. \\nFor as I can remember I’ve struggled with ADHD and anger issues. After middle school and throughout high school I started developing symptoms of anxiety, depression, insomnia, and borderline bipolarism. Im not sure if I can say I was bullied, but I have definitely been traumatized by certain friend groups and people. For example, in grades 8 and 9 I was in a toxic friend group with the older “cool kids”. Because I was the young one I was always seen as lesser and treated like I was everyone’s verbal punching bag. I would often be excluded from events or embarrassed in class because of the teasing. In grade 11 I once got confronted by an angry mob of big dudes because some guy that I beat up (in complete self defence) told someone that I was making fun of his autistic friend. This resulted in me getting circled and nearly lynched (not literally, at least I hope) for something I didn’t do. I still struggle with severe PTSD from that day. \\nI’m not fucked up all of the time, sometimes I’ll go weeks feeling like I’m on cloud 9. But no matter what it all comes back eventually. The only thing I’ve actually had diagnosed is ADHD, simply because I have no idea how to explain my other internal struggles nor do I want to. Very rarely will I tell someone that I need help. Anytime I’ve ever tried to bring them up friends or family my problems were trivialized and met with responses like “oh things will get better with time” or “just wait till you’re an adult, you’ll figure it out”. \\nWell I’m an adult now, and I sure as fuck haven’t figured it out. I struggle with the same issues I’ve had since I was a kid, and it’s made me feel so terribly isolated no matter how many friends/family I’m surrounded by. I’ve resorted to smoking weed every single day until I pass out to try and keep my problems at bay while I try to finish university. This has made me a lazy cunt that struggles to maintain what used to be my favourite hobby, bodybuilding. I’ve tried quitting a few times, however whenever I stay sober for long enough the dark stuff that’s haunted me my entire life just comes back. \\nI’ve had to quit drinking, I can’t party with my friends anymore because every time I get drunk I let out years of suppressed anger and frustration. I’ve gotten into many drunk fights, and it’s gotten to the point where I will talk shit to people twice my size without any rational thought behind it. While drunk, it’s either the version of me that loves everyone and will strike up a conversation with strangers to maybe get a laugh or some new friends, or it’s the version of me that is a complete asshole and wants to beat the shit out of anyone that gives even the slightest indication that they want to fight. This is why I ended up loving weed so much, when I’m baked I’m the nice version of myself that I recognize from when I was kid. Fuck I wish I could go back to my childhood.\\nI don’t blame people for not understanding, I can never communicate it properly. Every time I’ve met with my psychiatrist it’s like I’m describing a completely different issue, I often times over exaggerate or under exaggerate certain symptoms for literally no reason, it’s like I just panic and lie whenever someone try’s to get me to open up.

I don't know, I guess over time you start to sympathize with the kid who has crackhead parents and realize, there is an unlikely chance he is going down an educated path. Just by observing those people with same scenario my age. I look at homeless people and wonder the same thing. They are put on pills that keep them on streets because pharmacies is just a business. In my city the people prescribing them just need money and a job. The thing I hate most about myself too is the fact I feel sorry for myself, there are kids in the middle East who get drugged from a young age and used for militaristic purposes. There is the camps in China where people are getting raped, kids who are being kidnapped and used for organ harvesting and kept alive. People say the world is getting better but it feels blind. I know people in Canada like to seek themselves as good, but is buying a phone not technically supporting those evil acts. The truth is those phones are being made by underpaid workers in a different country.  There's also so many other issues. Like a lot of people hate on hip hop music and the hypersexuality and hypercriminalty aspect of it, but there's so many more layers to that. These artist who need to comply to middle class market since middle class kids bring in revenue from buying tickets to shows. They get all the blame for that type of music but the reality is they make it for the industry. If middle class kids liked bubbly music I'm a 100% certain these poor artist would start making music like that. The truth is in poor areas the reality is if you choose to go to school, you won't be able to support your familly so the two paths that do make enough money is selling drugs, or making music and blowing up. The other sad truth is 1 in some big number artist make it. Look at all those artist, most of the poor ones were criminals or lived a gangster lifestyle (in this generation). A lot of these artist don't want to do that. NBA youngboy (jail, drugs, etc), the Kelly (killed best friend), Kodak black (drugs, jail, etc).  \\nWhy don't they just do pop? No resources, not enough time to work a 8 hour job, sing, create, etc. A lot of pop artist have big teams. If your a female in a poor area you're even more screwed. Most famous female artist in the industry went to music schools, were rich, and had connections. Their isn't much opportunity for them that can support their love ones. We see those who succeeded but not many of those who didn't. A lot of them did put work in too. My whole point is humans are corrupt and some people get the back end of it while others get built up from those people. The pharmacies, the organ harvesters, etc. Even everyday people are, we just been dehumanized to it, or are just blind to their actions. Anyways I ask myself, why should you live if you're just at the bottom? Hope? We see all these inspirational stories but the reality is most people don't end up like that. You have to pick a poison. In the world we live in it's getting harder and harder for people to make it out. Kids getting drugged at young age, underpaid workers with no education and no one willing to hand that out. Homeless people, being put into a loop, and from what I've seen, a lot of ignorant people judging them. Why should I live, work 5 times harder, sacrifice all of my free time, just to end up having the same job as the other guy? Also, I mentioned I hate myself even more for being ungrateful cause some people have less, but why? Why should that be okay? Why is that something you can tell someone. Be grateful, someone out there has it way worse. I disagree with telling someone that. There should be a fine line. I think kids shouldn't get drugged from a young age and turned into tools. Why is suicide looked down upon is what I'm asking. Hell, should I tell that homeless person to have hope? Statistically speaking, things aren't getting better for him. Enjoy the little things. This is where I am just being a brat, but it's hard to enjoy those things when I don't know if I'm getting food tommorow, and then I see someone on social media skiing down a mountain with no cares in the world. Humans are competitive by nature and being at the bottom you don't have many sense of achievement especially in the era we live in. It kinda gets to you. What is the point of living? Friends and family I never see cause we all have our own schedules and are super busy busting our asses off? Also people do care they just to social media to help. Reality is that doesn't help. We had a protest in my city recently and the way protesting in this era works is you make a post on your page. You can't get violent or cause disruption or else you get arrested. Therefore you just watch them as they do the thing you don't want. It seems like half the time people bring awareness to stuff it's cause it's trendy too. I saw so many post on the Australian fires, but a few on the Uighur camps in China. I saw millions mourn the death of a rapper, but minimal awareness to other things that are way worse cause it isn't trendy. Respect to black live matters but but what happens if you do that with another race? It doesn't work. Some races are getting fucked over way harder in this day and age. No one puts their hand up cause it's not a trendy movement, not to say the movements they support aren't important. 8.4 mill on black lives and less than 100000 combined on Mexican and brown. Sorry random rants in random order. Lots to get off my chest. What's the point of living. I'm a brown guy from a poor neighbourhood so just being a famous artist would be way harder just cause of my colour. I looked it up, and found only 1 brown person in a list of upcoming artist and actors list. The rest were predominantly white or black. Statistically speaking, woman are less interested in brown guys. Even brown chicks guys from other races. I'd say a lack of media portrayal has a doing in that. The other options aren't so friendly either. Go to school and not support my family. Bust my ass off, start a business and make enough money but at that point my chances are the same in music. What's the point in living?

For one, my family is in very bad shape in terms of finances, especially due to the fact that my mother and father had a baby before he died. So it’s becoming difficult to pay for anything we need, like food, clothes, etc.. \\nOn the family side of things, most of us are just divided. Fights have broken out, causing some of us to just not show up to family gatherings anymore. It doesn’t really help that I wasn’t exactly close to any of them in the first place.

That the pain would finally end. On top of all that, I’m CONSTANTLY bullied, online and in real life, for enjoying the things that I do, or I just get bullied in general. I also struggle to make friends, because I feel extremely insecure. Most of the kids at my school are super popular, and I’m just this socially anxious, insecure kid in the corner. People tell me to have confidence and people will like me, but it doesn’t work. When I try to be confident and tell jokes and stuff, it leads to people calling me weird, laughing insultingly, or just being silent. Even the friends I do have do this sometimes. My best friend in the whole world (he has always had my back and never once insults me or anything, he just constantly tries to help me out) moved away and I never get to see him anymore.\\nI’m super sorry for the long explanation, I just really wanna feel better, but I keep losing hope by the minute.

I realized since I was perhaps a freshman in high school. Senior guys inviting me to parties, male teachers giving me special privileges and occasionally their eyes would wander away from my face. I didn’t really see a huge problem until I got to college. I wanted to date, find a nice guy to treat me right and I found it was super hard. \\nThe majority of guys that I talked to weren’t looking for anything more than a hookup. Some guys respected the fact that I didn’t want a hookup but the majority of guys would go along and pretend to want more when in reality they didn’t. When I would ask to get to know each other more before we do anything, I’d be called a tease, accused of leading them on and told hurtful stuff like “I’m sure other guys have been in your pants, why can’t I get some” do you know how hurtful that is. And eventually, complements meant nothing to me, I’d get so many and they all felt sexual in nature. They were all based off my looks and nothing more. \\nGuys with girlfriends were a lot of times the worst, if they saw me talking to their boyfriends, they’d get super jealous, if we’re studying for a test together, they assumed I’m trying to take their man. I would never try to get in between someone’s relationship and if your boyfriend decides to flirt with me, I’ll do my best to make him know I’m not interested but I’m not responsible for his actions so don’t get upset at me. And a lot of girls would just seem to be in competition with me and I’m not. Or some of them would make it seem as if they are worshiping me and it just felt weird. \\nThen things got worst how people assumed things I get stuff based off my looks strictly. Like I’m not going to lie people have given me special treatment but I’ve never requested it and I’ve never depended on it, I’ve always been dedicated to working hard and earning what I want. I remember my sophomore year I was taking a Number Theory class which is harder than it sounds. I took a test, the mean score was about a 55% and I got a 91% and a girl claimed I got a high grade based of my looks. I studied hard for that, I tried to get a group together where she was invited and she declined. On my test, the problems were done correctly, and she claimed it was based of my looks. That was just so hurtful. \\nAs time went on it just bothered, and I became depressed off of it based off the idea that I did not think I could ever find love. I’m a start girl, pretty but I felt like I could not find a guy to talk to where the topic of sex or my boobs did not come up before a couple conversions. It just felt like that’s all guys saw me for. And I know looks fade as time go, I don’t want a guy who just has sex with me then goes and brags to his friends, or realizes that I won’t always be this pretty and move on to another girl eventually. And I could not talk to people. Girls would always say they wish they had that as a problem, and guys would always “listen” and the next week they’re asking for pictures of my breast. And my family didn’t make things better either always asking why I don’t have a boyfriend, it must be so easy for me. \\nThat just always bothered me and brought me down significantly, I was never in a great state of depression but it was something that was just there and it was hard to talk to someone.

He came over and actually helped, he knew what he was doing. We talked a bit afterwards, found out we used to live in the same area. He’s a volunteer firefighter in the town over now and he’s an economics major with a math minor. Then he said he had to go, he didn’t get my name or ask for my Snapchat like most guys do. \\nThere was just something about him, the way he was super kind to do this gesture for me without expecting nothing in return. I was somewhat attracted to him. Luckily, I started seeing him on campus all the time and we would wave to each other. Eventually I got brave enough to go and talk to him and I did. We became friends and started talking a lot, he was super kind, funny and a weird sense of charisma. And I started realizing just how handsome he was along with his super muscular bodies. One thing led to another and we have been dating since then. This man treat me right, makes me so happy, makes me feel cared for and for much more than my body. Every conversation is not just about sex, he actually listen to me. Asks about my dreams and aspirations and I feel so comfortable around him. Every once in a while I do catch his eye wandering away but with him, I do enjoy it and sometimes his eyes would stay there a bit longer after I catch him haha. His complements mean much more to me, because they feel genuine and much more than something to get into my pants. I love this guy a lot, and I generally don’t advocate for getting into relationships to fix depression. But I’m this specific case it helped me, I’m so happy with him and I could see us lasting and I would like it to and he feels the same.

He took his own life. I worked with him for about a year and a half, he would go out for drinks with us every once in awhile, and him and I would go out by ourselves once a month or so. We weren’t super close, but we were good friends. When he quit, we stopped seeing each other as much. \\nThree weeks before he died, I called him up and asked for a huge favor. He lived within a mile of me and I needed his help changing a flat tire and wanted him to show me how. He had plans that night but said they could wait and he’d be over within an hour. When he arrived, I asked how he was doing and he made a sarcastic comment about how everything sucks. I asked if everything was okay and he said “not really, but that’s life!” He helped me change the tire, I gave him a hug and told him we should get drinks soon. Him and I had leaned on each other in the past when we were struggling so I wanted to be there for him. \\nI didn’t reach out soon enough. When I heard the news I was in shock. I was with a friend and went into their bathroom and literally fell to my knees and silently sobbed. When I drove home that night I cried. I took a different way home than normal and by coincidence passed the bar that him and I would go to. I had to pull over because I was crying so hard. I was sobbing and screaming “it would’ve been okay, I promise you. Everything would’ve been okay.” As if he could hear me. The next day, I had to leave work because I couldn’t stop crying.
