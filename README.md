# DepressionDetectionusingTransformer
Social media platforms play a major role in our day-to-day life. It is like a friend ,who will be there for  us to share our feelings all day. The content which is shared by users on social media replicate the userâ€™s internal life. Nowadays people love to share their daily life incidents like happy or unhappy (depressed) moments in social media. Everyone feels complete when they post their feelings in social media, it has  become a habit now-a-days. Social media provides a new chance to identify the feelings of a person through their sharing. The aim is to develop a model in which the system is capable of analyzing the grammatical markers related to onset and permanent symptoms of depression. We as a team participated in the shared task Detecting Signs of Depression from Social Media Text at LT-EDI 2022- ACL 2022 and we have proposed a model which predicts depression from English social media posts using the dataset[1] shared for the task. The prediction is done based on the labels moderate, severe and  not depressed. We have implemented this using different transformer models like Distilbert, Roberta and Albert and the Macro F1 score that we achieved was 0.4571 which brought us to the 23rd position in the leaderboard.
