I'd be at my grandparents house, having fun with my chihuahua. It was nice and calming, having no trouble when I need to get in a safe space. Peaceful music was played whenever I'd walk my dog. Competitive, yet smooth music played whenever I'd enter competitions. A fun experience was the least I could say. It was amazing.\\nI had a dog once. Well, not exactly my dog, it was my grandparents. We called him Bugsy (Bugzy?) and he was the best goddamn dog I knew. One day, my sisters and I were driving on a highway, when all of a sudden we heard a thud. We suddenly lost control of the vehicle, and we were forced to stop. When we collectively shit ourselves from what the hell just happened, my sister opened her door and went out to inspect what we hit.\\nIt was Bugsy. A few weeks before, he ran away. I wasn't sure why he did, he was living a perfectly comfortable life. Perhaps he was seeking adventure? Nonetheless, we killed him. We ran him over because we didn't see him coming. We weren't expecting this to happen. We cried. We didn't know what to do with the body. She quietly put the carcass on the side of the road, as to not be ran over by others.\\nA while later, I got a 3DS and my first game: Nintendogs. And unfortunately, it reminded me of Bugsy. I wish I could have done more for that dog. I truly miss him. I would take care of him as much as I have taken care of that dog in the 3DS.

I am the usual i guess, divorced parents that still hate each other after years of their break-up, but this just goes beyond everything i would have ever imagined. I used to live with my mother and it was hell, no better word to describe it. She used to insult me just for being, calling me a usseles son and an autistic no-one, constantly trying to make fun of me and shame me for everything she could, this went on for a couple years, around 2 or so, until finally some months back i snapped, i just couldn\\'t take it anymore. She started yelling at me for some stupid reason and i just tried to ignore her, but she entered my room and started just trowhing everything she could. My lap-top, my ps4, my phone, everything she could grab and throw into the wall was thrown. I just wasnt dealing with it anymore, the sadness just was pure madness at that point, i grabbed her and pushed her out of my room while she screamed at me full pshyco. I closed the door and hold it close while she tried to smash it down to get back in my room. She started crying and shouting to me things that i cant quite remember, at this point i was just pushing the door shut while crying. The moment was over-whelming, i tried my best to stay as stable as possible but i just felt so much anger and fear at the time. An hour later or so, my father showed up at my house and make me grab my stuff and leave. On the way to his apartment, he only stayed silent while looking at me, and i just tried my best to calm myself. When we arrived, he talked to me, he ask why did i did that and if i was okey with what i did. Soon i understood what he meant,my mother had called him telling him that i had hitt her and that i was just violent against women. My father never talked to me again about that, but afther that day things started to go down-fall.\\nI started going to the psychologist after that, my mother signed me up and made my father take me every week for about a month. There the stupid bitch talked to me about things like \"you should feel angry with women\" or \"hitting women is not okay\". I hated going, i hated going every week to be treated like a criminal, like if i was the one that needed help. After that i started living with my father, since my mother kicked my out of my house i had no where else to go. My room now is a little bed next to where he works. (He is a lawyer).\\nA month or so starting to get used to living with him i was just broken. I went from hanging out with friends every day and every night to stay away from home as much as possible to stay inside every-day whit my ps4, eating and doing as much as i could to avoid my friends, since they had no idea nor i have ever told them why i just stopped hanging out with them.\\nSince then my life has been a total disaster i dont want to try to fix anymore. I tried my best to go back to the person that i used to be, but every day its more and more difficult. I was just a normal kid, a 16 year old that would play ps4 and hang around with friends during the week and go partying some saturdays. Now im just a sad fucker, i still hang around with friends but i just dont feel the same anymore, i used to be the one that made everyone laughed and now im just the one that stays behind silent and laughs a little every now and then. My friends have noticed this but every time someone asks me \"is everything okay?\" Or \"are u fine?\" I just do my best to keep them away, what am i suppoused to say? That my mother is a psycho that kicked me out and my father beats me everythime he gets mad at me? I feel so ashamed, i feel so sad and angry, and i have to put all of that behind a mask of \"na bro, im fine, just sleepy\" and pretend im alright.\\nLike i said, my father gets angry at me for almost no reason, he hates that i play ps4, he hates that i go partying even tough he knows that i have always been really mature with the alchochol and that i have never ever had problems with it. There are nights where he just arrives from the job and sitts next to me, just to give me a large speech of how pathetic i am and how i will always be alone for the kind of person that i am, how no one will ever love me and how i will be left alone once he kicks me out of the house. I just do my best to cry as silently as possible, pretending that i dont care.\\nAll this happened in the summer, so when i had to come back school (i am from Argentina) i had to face my mother again. At my school, wich is the only thing i really care, you have to sitt for an exam to enter another year. This exam is really easy and i have always been a good student so it hasnt ever meant a real deal to me, but this year was different. My mother called my father and told him that if i didnt passed this exam she would make sure that i got kicked out of school, so my father made me stay home for two hole weeks \"studying\" while my mother called him every few hours to \"check on me\". I passed this exam with a 10 (A+ i guess) but those weeks were a nightmare, my father was all day yelling at me to keep studying and to focus or i would go to another shitty school. Those nights were when all the reason why i write this began, the suicidal thoughts\\nEvery night since those nights i cant avoid but think about how tired i am, how much i want to die and i really mean it. Every day i arrive home knowing that mu father will look at me into my eyes and give me that disaproving stare he always gives me. Every night i feel the door opening i drop my phone and pretend to be asleep so he doesnt talks to me. His words are knives into my very soul, i cant have peace anymore. Every time i look myself into the mirror i see everything that my father described, everytime i have time to think i just hear his words repeating themselves again and again, remembering me what i am and how little i deserve from others\\nI had dreams of being a doctor, i dreamed of finishing the book i was writing and i dreamed of getting to know someone else. Watching my ex next holding hands with another dude was like a bullet on a dead-body. It hurt, it really did, but at the time i was so fucked up that it meant nothing to me. Of course she gets to know someone new, she arrives home with a lovely mother and a care father that both treat her with respect and love. If i didnt had parents that hatted me i would be even better than her, but i am not, i am just a sad fuck that \"can\\'t get over it\" and she gets to laugh with her friends about me every time she sees me.\\nLast-night was when i snapped again. My father came to me while i was having dinner alone and he told me that he doesnt want me to be with him anymore. He says that i dont help around the house and that i am just wasting his money and his time. He told me that he is going to send me back with my mother and that i dont get to decide if i wnat it or not.\\nI dont want to go, but i dont want to stay neither. My father does and did horribles things to me, but my mother is just hell to me, i cant deal with it anymore, i wont\\nI want to kill myself, i want to get up right now from the bed and sneek trough his bedroom, i want to go to the roof and jump.

Please, i dont want to go to a psychologist and be treated like a criminal again. I know that my father wont care if i tell him how i feel, he will just get even more angry at me.

Who knows\\nWhat I do know is that I’m definitely not normal. I’ve always felt a diluted sense of emotions. Sometimes I’m just unable to truly feel, and I doubt whether the emotions I do feel are real or figments that’s I’ve conjured up. I’m definitely an apathetic person, without care for really anything, having to force myself to care about goals or people. And so I find it difficult to empathize with others, in fact I find it impossible to truly connect with others. Because I don’t care about the people I should care about. I have a long history of hurting those I care about, abandoning them or saying hurtful things because I want to see them hurting. I don’t really know why. Maybe I’m just psychotic. But I never truly felt bad for others even when I know I should. I just don’t feel capable of caring about people. But I’m not entirely emotionless either (apparently I can’t even commit to that). I do feel severe guilt in honesty. I feel guilt that I don’t care as much as I should. I feel melancholy when I realize I don’t have as strong of a connection to people as I should. I wish I could just have normal attachments and sentiments to people but, people come and go, and I simply could not care in the slightest. But it hurts me to realize that. To realize that I should care but I don’t. And I feel pity for those who care. Which is why I try pushing people away. Because I don’t want to hurt them, but I know I will. So I keep them away from me so they don’t have to hurt. Whether if that’s because I do care about their feelings or to simply avoid feeling guilty I don’t know, but that’s the way it is. So if you know me and your reading this, I’m sorry for, everything I know I’ve done.

I just don’t want you to get hurt.\\nBut that’s just the people. That’s just my emotions and my sociable aspects of all the shit. Of course it can’t be that simple, there is much much more. Where does the apathy come from however? In short, I’m unable to care for others and for even myself, because I don’t feel attached to anything. I mean I literally don’t feel attached to myself. For visual reference is feels like I’m a ghost attached to a host which is my body. I feel a strange disconnect to myself and to the world. I feel as though I’m not the person I see in the mirror. Almost as if I’m simply an observer of my own world, of my own story. I feel like I have no true control but only the illusion of control. I feel trapped and I feel detached. Sometimes I even feel PHYSICALLY detached. Sometimes I feel as if I’m being pulled apart from my body, I feel lighter and I feel numb and cold. So it feels like I’m not me if that makes sense. So how am I supposed to be attached to things in a world that doesn’t seem real? It feels like I’m reading a story, I read the lives of these characters and for a time, I enjoy it and I care for these people. However it’s a fake emotion, because these people simply aren’t real, they are fictional characters in a fantasy world. That’s what everything feels like to me, like everything doesn’t matter because it’s all fake, because it feels like it’s all fake, so why should I give a shit? \\nAnd the apathy is one of the worst things. It makes me unmotivated and it makes me not do the things I do want to do. I can’t solve any of my problems because I don’t care enough to try. I waste every opportunity handed to me because I couldn’t give a shit. So not only am I a mental fucking mess, I’m also just a shitty person. A person who both, doesn’t care about others, and doesn’t contribute. And it’s not as if I can’t achieve. So much feels as if I can accomplish without trying, how I made it thus far. I’ve managed my way through school without even trying, usually doing better than a lot of the students. I am and always have been able to learn quickly and I could’ve been an amazing student, however I don’t care enough to make that a reality. So many times teachers tell me of my potential, that wasted potential I was given that I refuse to do anything about. Because I simply don’t give a shit about myself or others to make it a reality. And so I waste time, and I waste resources, and I am a waste of just everything ever handed to me. I refuse to let others waste their time on me because I don’t see the point. I hate when people try to help me because I won’t change, because I don’t care enough to change. So if you read this and think you want to try and give me advice or try and “save me”, don’t, because you’ll just waste your breath. It won’t change me, because I don’t want to change, I think of myself as too much of a waste to get help. I’m too far gone, it’s too late. So please. Save yourself the bother, don’t even try to help me. That goes for both strangers and my friends.\\nEven now I’m getting tired of writing this, because I know it doesn’t matter, it’s just me talking to no one. If you’re actually reading this, and for some reason you care, don’t, because I don’t even care so why should you?  I know it’s just me rambling, it doesn’t even make sense probably. I’m speaking to the void, to an audience I don’t know. It doesn’t matter anyways. There is so much I want to say so many thoughts but I just don’t know what they are they over take me. So this isn’t everything as I wanted it to be but I guess it’s enough. It doesn’t matter\\nHowever I want to leave with one last note, one important thing I just NEED to say. I don’t know how I’ve made it this far. I don’t know why I’ve made it this far. I don’t know why I wake up or what I’m planning on going for or how long I’m going but I just keep going. I’ve tried to kill myself. Even now I want to kill myself. I want to grab a rope and walk into the woods, and never come out. It’s just the way I feel. I’m tired of living a life where I’m not happy, and I’m not going to be happy, where I don’t care and I won’t care, where there is nothing and there is going to be nothing. What’s the point! I want to disappear, I wish I could just stop. I wish I had died to those pill all those years ago, I wish the rope hadn’t snapped I wish I could just do it. But I’m too much of a coward. Because I know I need to die and that it’s fruitless to keep going but I just don’t. I don’t know what the point of any of this is. The letter or my life. I just want to die. That’s what I truly feel.

As I grew up I\\'ve witnessed the town falling apart and everyone leaving. My mom was one of those people. Being a decent English speaker she decided to move to the US in an attempt to start a new life. Before she left; she promised to me and my grandma that she will get us out of there. However, it would be years until her promise would be fulfilled.\\nMy town wasn\\'t the only thing failing to succeed. I was a bad test-taker and my grades were awful. My grandma was a regular visitor in my principal\\'s office. I hated my life and started hanging with the wrong people just to feel the sense of belonging and approval.\\nFinally, on September of 2016, me and my grandma get a call from my mom saying that she got married, found a stable job and has already bought us tickets to the United States. Our excitement was immeasurable.\\nAfter all these years I thought that I would finally stop being a loser and become a new, better version of myself. I was never so wrong in my entire life...\\nChapter 2 - Melting Pressure\\nDuring the first 2 months of me being here, my mom and my stepdad send an application to a local high school. My stepdad is from Trinidad and Tobago and has seen what the lack of education can lead to. He was very impatient with me going to high school as soon as possible. I was super stressed out. I didn\\'t know a whole lot of English; I didn\\'t have any friends over here; I didn\\'t know the culture and the expectations that American teens had.\\nBeing a bad test-taker and being pissed by the apathy that a lot of teachers had towards their students; I decided to cheat. My logic was that if you don\\'t wanna bother putting any energy in gettin your students interested - I\\'m not gonna put any energy in studying your material. Miraculously, I managed to graduate the high school.\\nNow there was another challenge - going to college. I took 6 SATs in the following months after my graduation and I failed every single one of them. After my final SAT I said fuck it and decided to join the Army. If I can\\'t work with my brain let\\'s see if I can work my muscles. My parents weren\\'t too happy about me joining, but they understood the lack of other options.\\nChapter 3 - Sweat and Sorrow\\nTurns out I suck at being a soldier as well.\\nI barely graduated BCT (Basic Combat Training) with all the minimum requirements. 1 less pushup or sit up or 10 seconds more on the run - and I would fail. From that point I already knew that the chance of me graduating AIT (Advanced Individual Training) wasn\\'t too high either. I was right. On October 2018, I got a knock on the door from my drill sergeant saying that I will not participate in the graduating ceremony (both of us already knew that, he just had to make it official).\\nThe process of being discharged is not quick and it takes weeks, sometimes months. During this tiem I met a guy who offered me to move to Nebraska to live with him and 2 other roommates. He was living with his parents, I was living with mine and I didn\\'t sound like a bad option. I agreed.\\nHe left 2 weeks before me and before he left we exchanged the numbers.\\nChapter 4 - Great Plains Are Not So Great After All\\nAfter I got home, my parents were both happy and dissapointed. There was an unpleasant feeling of uncertainty in the house that none of us liked. After giving myself a couple of days to rest, I decided to call him \\\\[the guy I met in the Army\\\\] and ask if he is still down to move out. He says yes.\\nAfter a short conversation with my parents we decided that maybe starting over in a new state will help somehow. I bought a plane ticket the same day and was gone within a week.\\nI moved in, I got my NE ID, found a job. Everything was fine at first and for the first time I thought that maybe something will finally work out. Unfortunately, I wouldn\\'t be writing this post if everything went fine. After living together for 5+ months we \\\\[me and my roommates\\\\] started to get into conflicts and disputes. It reached it\\'s climax on March 8, when my \"buddy\" started spreading rumors about me and had enough of it. I told him that if he doesn\\'t stop, bad things will happen. He didn\\'t stop. \\nThat evening - me, him, and another roommate got into a huge fight. Fucked up all of the living room, threw a couple of dishes at one another, etc. To put it shortly, after the fight was over all we wanted to do was to kill one another. I had to move out.

I\\'ll try to to organize this as best I can, but I\\'m in a pretty emotional state right now so it might be messy or hard to read. \\nSo I feel like either:\\nA. My parent or parents have fucked me up due to either awful parenting or non existent parenting. I\\'ve never had my biological father in my life. Just countless men that didn\\'t really care about me and just wanted my mother for sex before they could leave and move on to the next mentally unstable single mom. One of them I thought was my real father until I was 8 years old which kind of fucked with me when I found out that who I thought was my father was actually like the 5th or 6th man she\\'s been with at that point. I even called him \"dad\" for years. I can\\'t imagine how he felt having this kid he wants nothing to do with call him their father. I kind of feel bad for him looking back on it. Maybe I was just a really stupid kid and that was my fault for getting attached to someone that didn\\'t give a fuck about me.\\nMoving on though. Getting off topic a bit. More behind point A. My mother since I was maybe 2-4? Has been an extremely narcissist drunk/druggie with mental issues that has only ever cared for herself. She sure could put on a good show in front of others to make it seem like she was the world\\'s perfect parent, but once back home it was \"I want nothing to do with you, leave me alone and go play your games or something so I can drink my pain away\". This left me feeling, yet I didn\\'t realize it at the time or even know I felt this way that it was my fault that she or my real father didn\\'t love me. Why else would he not be in the picture and she wants nothing to do with me? Obviously it\\'s my fault right? I hate myself today, but feel so much love and feel so sorry for that kid back then. Sigh... \\nMessed up the post a bit so it may be out of order of how I intended it to be so sorry for that. \\nFrom a young age I feel like I\\'ve had the idea \"ok, nobody cares about you, you\\'re all that you have and it will always be that way\". All of this started fucking with my head especially when I would see kids with their extremely loving and caring parents just enjoying life like it was so natural for them. I would think \"yeah there is definitely something wrong with me. That\\'s why these kids are loved and I\\'m not.\" I\\'d see kids make mistakes or anything that kids will obviously do because they\\'re kids, and still be loved the same regardless of what they\\'ve done. I on the other hand would make a mistake or do anything kids do and it would become the end of the world. \"You broke something? You\\'re so fucking stupid! Why the fuck were you so clumsy?!\" Or \"You don\\'t want to come to church with me every Sunday to be forced to believe in something you truly don\\'t?\" \"You\\'re ruining my perfect social image\"! She didn\\'t actually say the last part but you know what I mean by that. \\nShe would tell me how ungrateful I am everytime I wouldn\\'t do something she said. \"You wouldn\\'t even exist because of me.\" She thought that since she birthed me, she owned me and treated me like I wasn\\'t my own person. She would say \"I brought you into this world and I have the power to take you out of it.\" I became very lost and confused from a young age. \\nIt also doesn\\'t help that my mine and my brother\\'s only parent, yeah I didn\\'t mention my brother yet, but he is from a different father as well so we are half-brothers both without fathers and stuck with our unfortunately biological mother. Thank god I had him and he was street smart because he kept himself and I alive. Anyway she ended up abandoning us one night when we were 10 and 14. Me 10 him 14. We were hanging out with his friends one night and when we went back home the house was locked and she was nowhere to be found. I of course blamed myself. Sigh... Turns out she just left the state without telling anyone. My brother\\'s friend\\'s mother offered us a place to stay until she was heard from and we had to live with his friend for 6 months before finally hearing that she was in rehab.\\nOr maybe it was option B: I was fucked up since birth and they never told me anything and just pretended like I was normal, but deep down they knew the \"truth\" and loved me less for it and treated me accordingly. I have no clue if there is something wrong with me to this day or not but honestly even if there wasn\\'t I feel like I\\'ve become fucked up and now something may be wrong wrong with me regardless because of point A. Either way I feel fucked. Too fucked to ever live a normal happy life. To do the things most take for granted. To find love, get a job, start a career, to live with my partner, develop hobbies, enjoy life, etc.\\nI\\'m 19 years old and I\\'ve never been in a loving relationship, yet desperately craving to be in one. I know it is unrealistic for someone like me though so I try to say \"Hey life\\'s unfair, you\\'re just one of the unlucky one\\'s. Deal with it.\"\\nI\\'ve never had a job. Fear, depression, anxiety, and insecurity, along with who knows what others mental issues I may have have prevented me from trying to get one. I don\\'t think I even meet the qualifications for a McDonald\\'s crew member. Which leads me to the next point.\\nI failed the 7th grade and dropped out in 9th. I\\'m not sure if these were because of A. Fucked up childhood and the mental issues along with it. Or B. I\\'m just retarded and I\\'m destined to live an unhappy unsuccessful life because of it.\\nI have nothing good in my life it seems. I just want to idk maybe love someone and be loved by someone.

I may have only one appointment, though I'm not 100% on that. \\nSome pointform background: \\n- my single parent suffered significant depression\\n- my parent was hospitalized in a psychiatric facility when I was very young and we were separated for some time \\n- I developed nervous tics and anxious behaviour \\n- I have since learned about the significant self-harm my parent was engaging in during this time and leading up to the next point\\n- my parent was diagnosed with Gender Dysphoria and came out to me as trans and gay when I was 11\\n- i adjusted quickly and had little trouble understanding with the help of therapy and proper information \\n- my parent adjusted well, and recovered significantly\\n- anxiety driven behavior worsens, nervous tics vanish (pre-teen) \\n- bullied lots, sometimes very violently (pipes, stabbed) usually related to my family or some assumption that I was also LGBT. \\n- some heavy drug and alcohol use throughout teen and early adulthood (MDMA, cannabis, psilocybin, nicotine, alcohol)\\n- long-time friend drastically increases his involvement with violent neo-nazi group (late teens)\\n- moved to new city \\n- entered into relationship, victim of intense abuse for 8 years (verbal, emotional, psychological, sexual, economic)\\n- health issues during the abusive relationship: widespread joint pain, off work for depression, injuries at work(including substantial back injury which results in me using a cane periodically to this day), and depression again. \\n- minimal therapy after leaving abuse\\n- off work periodically for a while post-relationship\\n- first lung collapse at end of 2014 right before big move to new province with current gf (8weeks recovery, life threatening)\\n- second lung collapse early 2015 (quit smoking, 7 weeks recovery)\\n- lose job over missed time, health and anxiety\\n- third lung collapse in early 2016 (6 weeks recovery)\\n- fourth lung collapse in mid 2016 (6 weeks recovery) \\n- fifth lung collapse in January 2017 (6 weeks recovery)\\n- move to hometown to care for parent after they are diagnosed with stage 3C lung cancer (April 2017)\\n- parent diagnosed with Stage 3CG1 Colorectal cancer (August 2017)\\n- sixth lung collapse in February 2018 immediately followed by surgery. Lung wrapped around heart, effectively strangling it. Recovery 3.5 months, ongoing. Never really recovered properly from this. Pain, discomfort, numbness, restricted breathing, fatigue and anxiety persist. \\n- Parents diagnosis upgraded to Stage 4C\\n- Seventh lung collapse in June 2018 (small, recovered with no medical intervention)\\n- gf's mental health begins to spiral out of control, including an affair with coworker. Her memory of july to september is hazy at best. She stops working August 2018\\n- gf attempts suicide by overdose. This was my last day of work (Sept 24 2018)\\n- my 33rd bday (Sept 26 2018)\\n- parent announces they bought a house and their intent to move 45 minutes outside of town by the end of October 2018 (my gf and I dont drive, and need access to medical care, so we moved into an apartment) \\n- 8th lung collapse in January 2019, surgery in mid-February (happens to be one day after my parents major cancer related surgery, after which he is left with an stoma). 5 days in hospital, long recovery. \\n- temporary government assistance begins april 2019\\nMy question is, how do I approach this appointment? \\nI am not ready to go back to work, at least not in the sense that I ever have, and I am unlikely to resume life the way it ever was. \\nI struggle around people to a debilitating degree, I have a hard time leaving my house outside of a handful of reasons, I have no desire to make, maintain or pursue friendships and I havent had any interest in many, many years now. My physical abilities are compromised and I'm exhausted constantly alongside everything else. \\nAny input would be so greatly appreciated, as I cannot see my way forward. \\nI'm sure to be missing so much, but this is what was immediately significant. \\nTL;DR (as best I can) \\nLife filled with intense depression, anxiety debilitating trauma and spousal abuse, persistant and crippling health issues, and terminal illness in the family has left me a person I barely recognize. I realize that much can change, but also lots wont. \\nHow do I approach a psychiatrist appointment and doctors from my new reality and perspective, knowing both I am not ready to go back to work and am unlikely to resume life the way it was?\", 'text_b': None, 'label': 1}, {'guid': 282, 'text_a': 'I\\'m supposed to be \"objectively\" happy, but I\\'m not and I just need something. : To explain a little of my backstory, I\\'ll try and give as much details about my life without being too specific. I used to go to a really good high school that you had to test to get in to. I was projected to do very well and a lot of people, i.e. friends and family thought i would succeed and use this high school as a launching point. I crumbled under the pressure, and i felt so insecure about my place in life that all i could do was basically sit at home and play league and contemplate the meaning of self-harm. I eventually transferred out of that high school and into another one where i skimped by. I had many many many therapy sessions before i graduated high school, a majority of them focused on the societal and familial pressures that i felt were placed on me because i was not living up to the expectations that they nor I had. I graduated high school with a sub par gpa and eventually went to a college, following another one of my closest friends. My first year of college consisted of one of my first friends committing suicide, this hurt me so deep because it really altered what i had personally preconceived people with depression as. See, this particular friend was always the highlight of the group, the leader, the percy jackson main character that seemed to have everyone else follow. I was in and out of college at that point, withdrawing and dropping out basically. I eventually moved away and then got a job. I had many more therapy sessions, dealing with my deeper psychological problems ranging from self-hatred to a constant need for approval from others. I eventually stopped counseling, i had thought i got better. I started dating a girl i had met online. I decided to go back to school, because I have support systems, a drive to finish college, to provide for myself and my future significant other. However, I\\'m not happy. I\\'m not happy right now, regardless of how well I\\'m doing in college, how good my relationship is going, my family\\'s health are all standard. I\\'m simply not happy, and i\\'ve been disassociating to the point where sometimes i can see myself from a third point of view and I don\\'t know how to explain it to the people around me, to the girlfriend that loves and supports me. I can honestly say that for the first time in a while, I want to die, for no particular reason. I simply wish to... cease existence. But i know i can\\'t just do that. I know how much it would hurt the people i care about. But i don\\'t know how to stop this downward spiral that is slowly eating away at my psyche like a worm inside of an apple. Please help me, I beg you.', 'text_b': None, 'label': 1}, {'guid': 283, 'text_a': \"Mental Health and Self Harm : Looking after our mental health is paramount for us to function. If we are more mentally stable we can do almost anything. But if it's unstable, an infinite amount of things become impossible. When someone's mental health starts to deplete, they start to lose memory or not remember things properly. It annoys us just as much as everyone else. \\nWe get agitated quickly. Focus too hard on a question or task. Get distracted too easily. Telling a story that would usually take 5 minutes would turn into 15-20 minute stories. Our mood changed too quickly for our own good. We can go from being overly active one minute to laying in bed for 3 days straight. Company is somewhat good, if around the right people. And relationships are probably the hardest thing to ever keep up when your mental health is unstable. We end up more often than not destroying the relationship and pushing them away for good. And when you push away the person who is supposed to help and support you, there is something wrong, but you can't do anything to stop it.\\nNow self harm can be a lot of things. It can be the obvious like cutting, overdosing, or other things alike. But it can also be things like; getting a tattoo or piercing, scratching or picking a scab on your body, plucking or pulling out hairs, getting into a bath or shower that's just a little more on the hot side, not eating, eating too much, biting your lips, pushing loved ones away, or anything else which seems mundane or not self harm-ish. To some degree, every single person has self harmed. Some worse than others, of course. Some have reason, some don't. And there are people and things out there to help. Not all methods work, but they're there anyway.\\nWhen someone's mental health is going downhill or spiralling, the best thing you can do is try to support them and be there for them. I am guilty of pushing the one person I love away and making him hate me so much that he didn't even want to hear my voice on the phone, and now we are no longer together. I'm on my own now, which is difficult. It is never easy fighting everything on your own, and the person who was meant to be there is no longer around or wants anything to do with you.\\nSo if you know someone who is spiralling, help them.

The world is big and vast and for that there are some topics that not everyone is aware. This won´t solve your problems but can make somethings clear. \\nYou , like anyone else, were brought into this world and you embodied specific body characteristics , home environment , family , local community , physical and mental skills that you did not choose. This makes it look that our lives are not so free as we think. Everyone has a journey, a wound and a purpose in life. Anything that is alive , even if it is for one second , will impact in the universe in some way.\\nWhy would someone be born into this world and repeat the **same type of  stressful situations over and over** ? Well, like i said, everyone has a **journey** and a **wound** and a **purpose**, we need obstacles and adversities to progress towards our purpose.\\nWhat is the point of being born in your best self? What is there to achieve if i already know what i need to know? Exactly! **You are born to face certain obstacles that will make you learn  certain lessons in life so that you can progress**. You need to let go of the pain and go against the other direction, the right one. I do not mean resistance, but acceptance.\\nLife gives us the exact tools for us to achieve our unique purpose ,it presents us with our skills , when the time is right it shows us the right people and situations to progress, otherwise you will be stuck in a never ending loop.  \\nIn the end, after every chapter in your life , you will dispose what you don´t need anymore for your progress.\\nEvery living thing ,dies every day, we die every day, we dispose of the yesterday and embrace the tomorow, while living and experience the today. **It´s when you hold the yesterday that pains and stagnates people.**  \\nWe can conclude from this that **we grow from hardship and not from stagnation.**\\nAbout other people, when you see someone that has a certain opinion , acts a certain way  that goes against your way of being , ask yourself what did this person had to go through to end up like this? You need to accept that people are the way they are, but this does not mean that they have the right to do what they want. Know and love who people are , but if needed put them in their place or stop them. Don´t ruin yourself for others, just accept them.\\nAbout depression, let´s be honest, it´s ugly and highly unappealing, but there are times that you need to be thrown to the floor so that you can get back up.We are attracted to smiles , confidence, people who take care of themselves and we reject the opposite , this is mostly unconscious ,but it is in our biology.  \\nThe way you view life will attract like minded people and situations, like i meant earlier, **chaos attracts chaos , self-love and acceptance attract self-love and acceptance.**\\nThere are certain things that makes men and women more attractive , like having a good/straight posture and not being curved, shoulders down or keeping good amount of eye contact when talking to someone instead of not looking at all. Fight for yourself, get a house if you can, get a job, it doesn't matter, just fight.  \\nDon´t be sloppy , don´t let go of yourself because you are feeling down. Try and be the best version you can be.  There aren´t any heroes , princes , or princesses that will come to aid you , You are your own savior.\\nKnowing all this , specially the part about life and death , you can develop something inside of you that will protect and shield you from these bad moments and that is called **Faith**.  \\nNo i do not mean religion , i mean faith.

I moved across the country about 1.5 years ago and while I love my new state a lot has happened and it's been extremely difficult adjusting at times. I also miss my friends and family from back east.\\n4. I feel numb most of the time. It is so hard to feel any real joy or happiness. I just feel hollow and life feels unfulfilling. I struggle with suicidal thoughts at times because I cannot imagine living like this for the rest of my life. I can't even bring myself to cry anymore. \\n5. I have so many goals I want to meet but I don't have the strength or ambition to pursue them. This makes me feel useless and like a complete failure. \\n6. I absolutely feed my own depression with bad habits but I can't seem to change them (at least not permanently). This makes me feel like I can't even change even though I desperately want to. \\n7. I feel detached from most people and have very little faith in humanity in general. I don't care for the way the world is today at all.\\nI don't want to be this person.

I love to look down on myself and think the worst, so how I deal with it is to make myself busy with life. School and side activities, part-time jobs and partying. But now that I’ve had extra time I get remembered of demons and all the reasons why I think I am a failure.\\nFirst, I get so surprised and jealous of people who have a good relationship with their siblings and nieces. I have four siblings, one of them passed away last year, and I have seven nieces. I am the youngest in my family so the age gap between us is huge since I came into the picture rather late. My relationship with my siblings is non-existing, and not because they are bad people or anything, we were just never close. I also live in another city than them which doesn’t make it easier to get in touch. I feel like I actually don’t know anything about them, and they know nothing about me. I don’t know what kind of music they listen to, what they like to eat or what their dreams in life are and same can be said from them about me. And the thing is I really do want to get closer to them, but I get so anxious around them and I can’t relax. I feel like a personality-less person who doesn’t even know how to talk to my own fucking siblings, and this fucking breaks my heart because I have this barrier that won’t let me just be calm and be myself. The only thing that helps me take down that barrier is alcohol, and anxiety and alcohol doesn’t mix well together. But I love the feeling of losing the barrier that helps me talk relaxed to people, the feeling to just make friends with the whole wide world. But the day after a night of heavy drinking comes the anxiety that won’t let me leave the bed and I won’t even open my phone for HOURS because I always have this fear of finding something horrible when unlocking the phone, even though I KNOW that there isn’t anything bad there.\\nWhen I’m feeling my worst this anxiety won’t let me open chats in messenger, the whole app just makes me anxious, the mere thought of someone wanting to get a hold of me makes me want to throw the phone in the lake and take a flight to a jungle were no one will find me. My mailbox, both email and at home get filled because I have the fear of finding something I won’t like. \\nI, like maybe most people here, feel very lonely since I don’t have a relationship with my siblings nor with my closest friends. I wish to find love, to go on tinder dates or just fall in love with someone from school.\\nBut I always tell myself that I’m not enough for anyone and that I am all too boring for anyone to find interest in me, and to go on a date and get rejected just scares me too much which then leads to me just not going on any dates at all. But I have had guys showing interest in me, but I get too scared and push them away by telling myself that we would not match and last anyway, or by going home together after a night at the club and not being able to handle the situation afterwards. And then being left with my thoughts and convincing myself that it’s for the best because I like being alone anyways. \\nFriends. I’ve met a lot of people in my life, but I’m not very good at keeping them in my life. People try to get into my life but I get uncomfortable and either ghost or get annoyed by them and just wish them to get out of my life even though they are good people. Or when I’m with people I actually do like I get scared that I am too plain and boring and not too exciting for them to stay with me. I get this anxiety and start to pressure myself to present myself in a way that will make them interested in me, kinda like if they are a crowd at a theater and I am the actor that needs to keep them entertained so that they won’t leave the salon. That Is why, if I don’t get invited to one smaller thing or don’t hear of something they all seem to know I take it so fucking personal even though they didn’t even mean to not include me. But since I am so unsecure about myself it tears me apart and I start to question myself, my worth and what the fuck I am doing on this planet. I suck at calling people or asking people how they are.\\nMaybe someone can relate, but writing this out calmed me down a bit and I hope that I will find the strength to come back to this thread and read the possible comments (if anyone actually reads this wall of text, sorry!) because anxiety. \\nLots of love from this anxiety filled blob.', 'text_b': None, 'label': 1}, {'guid': 400, 'text_a': 'Advice for people recovering? : I think I am getting better with depression.

Since the age of 4 my mother would work 14 hour shifts every single day and the only other people who could take care of me were abusive. My brother would physically assault me with punches and with finger penetration of my Rectum, and when I was left alone with my sister she would lock me in the closet so that she could go out with her friends and my mother would arrive at 2 am with me soiled and scared in the closet. I promised myself to never allow myself to be that weak again so I distanced myself from everybody to better myself. As I grew my family became closer to god, but quite the opposite happened to me. I didn’t feel that a god could exist that would allow kids to go through such hardships. They constantly tried to apologize for their behavior, but it’s just things that I will never forget, they ruined my perspective on life and completely ruined any future relationships I would have with people. Throughout high-school I made my family very aware that I would leave the very first opportunity I received because I didn’t feel comfortable around them. I signed a contract to join the military when I was 17, but before I left I managed to get my first ever girlfriend. Amazing girl, great heart and beautiful as can be. She instantly made me regret signing my contract, but the deed had been done. I left to basic training on the month of my 18th birthday, and although leaving my new love was very hard, I was ecstatic to be away from such a toxic family. Throughout basic training I would stay up past lights out just to write her a letter and a poem every night, at that time I knew I would marry this girl. (I know so cliche to marry your first love in the military) I would go visit this girl every 6 months, and I ended up getting her pregnant on one of these trips back home, unfortunately for us, I was 18 and she was 17. We wanted to wait for her to turn 18 before we involved the government in any type of family movement, but once she turned of age it was too late to try to get her to live with me. I was doing an overseas tour and I was told to wait for my tour to be over. I missed a year and a half of my sons life, and throughout my tour I felt like an empty shell. I would talk to nobody, I wouldn’t eat, I wouldn’t exercise. I would just work and go home. Maybe it was the distance, or maybe it was all my emotional issues getting in the way, but my feelings for this girl weren’t the same, and I felt like the only thing saving me from doing anything stupid to myself was the fact that I had my baby boy waiting for me at home. I just got home last week, and this boy is amazing. He makes me feel like I have never felt before, but every now and then there’s just a switch in my head that reminds me that I’m just living a lie. Even then I would never leave him, I just couldn’t. I wouldn’t let him be raised without a father like I was. His mom is amazing and we’re still together, and I feel like it’s my fault for not telling her about my mental state, but she isn’t the most supportive person in the world when it comes to my emotions. It’s just really hard to explain to her how I’m feeling because most of the time I don’t even know how I’m feeling. Today she playfully touched my Rectum even though I’ve told her  plenty of times that I don’t like that, and I just got furious and upset because it reminded me of my past experiences and I almost broke down. I later brushed it off as if it were nothing, but I feel like there should be no reason for me to justify something I’ve told her not to do. She then pulled an innocent cheating prank on me on the span of 3 hours that really got me upset so we both went to separate rooms to cool off. I was over it so I walked into the room with our kid ready to make amends before all hell broke loose. Mind you, I just landed from Europe 5 days ago and I am still a bit jet lagged so I was really looking to take a nap, but as soon as I stepped in she asked me why I brought my son in if he wasn’t ready to go to sleep, he still wanted to sleep. I told her to take him out if she would like to because I was very tired, and she just angrily stormed out reminding me how useless I am for not taking care of my kid. I haven’t had the practice of being a dad and I completely agree with her statement, I just feel like a piece of shit. Sometimes I just feel like it would be better for my son to just get a cut of my life insurance instead of having me around and just get all\\nOf this over with.

They would extend it if I got a valid visa extension.\\nI went to a solicitor, he said that I would waste around €3000 on this visa application, there was only a 5% chance that would get the visa, I won\\'t get a refund on the application fees and the visa officers take this advertisement clause seriously and I do not meet the criteria. He asked me to get in touch with my workplace again and see if they\\'re willing to advertise it again. They denied again. \\nMy fiance and I don\\'t necessarily have the money to get married right now. It also does not feel right to get married just for a visa. I know it would be the easier way out but this is not why we want to get married. \\nWe decided to move to Canada in 2020. Because he is from that European country, he\\'s okay in terms of Canada visas, he already got his visa. My visa to his country expired in December 2019 and I came back to my country after spending Christmas with his family. \\nIt was one of the hardest things I have had to do, saying goodbye to my friends there, my colleagues and the beautiful home my fiance and I lived in together. I cannot get over how unjust this was. I gave this charity everything I had for the last 2 years and all fucking HR could say was we\\'re so sorry. \\nI came back home to Asia, my life here is falling apart too. My parents have lived in a love less marriage for 27 years now. They hate each other, each others families. My dad\\'s been cheating on my mom for 10 years now, we all know it. My mother has the darkest circles under her eyes and her health has degraded so much in the past few years, on the other hand my dad is progressing towards becoming a full blown alcoholic. \\nThey\\'re finally separating. I\\'m glad about it. They stayed together all this time just to raise me and my brother and because of the \"what will people say\" mentality of the society we live in. My family is falling apart though, celebrating festivals will never be the same, my brother and I won\\'t have one permanent home anymore, we\\'ll always visit our parents separately.\\nI also have to borrow some money from my father to take to Canada because what I had saved is not enough. Almost every day when my father is drinking, I hear him talk on the phone to his relatives or friends accusing me of how I have made him spend all this money, how he will never get it back, how I\\'ve made him a poor man. I\\'ve said it to him that I will start paying him back as soon as I start working. My fiance is also back in his home country, working and saving up for our move. \\nHe\\'s a brilliant partner. He came to see me in my country for about 3 weeks. He looks after me, knows what I\\'m going through and he\\'s always there to talk to me or just be sad with me. I don\\'t mind the distance between us, it\\'s only for a few months. \\nBut I\\'m hopeless about everything else in my life. We started to plan our wedding, we decided that we\\'ll do it by the end of 2021, after we have settled in Canada with new jobs and everything. \\nBut no. I do not feel happy or excited about a single thing. I know that I should be grateful, I have my mom and my fiance and my best friend, I know they\\'re always here for me but nothing is helpful. Nothing at all. I don\\'t see the light at the end of the tunnel. My career is in shambles, my parents are breaking up, my home is breaking up. My confidence, my happiness, my attitude, everything has been broken down in the past few months. There\\'s something eating me up from the inside but I still don\\'t feel like I can talk to anyone around me. I cannot take it anymore. I\\'ve hurt myself in the past and it scares me how good it actually feels. I\\'m trying not to do it again. All the things that I found happiness in before, I simply don\\'t now. Just getting out of bed is the hardest thing to do. I try to sleep for most of the day, it makes it less painful. I don\\'t know if I\\'ll ever feel better. Does it get better? Will it every get better? Someone please say yes, please say that it will get better. It has to.

My mother was the onley one to figure out waht was going on withe me said its okey, and everybody left. \\nI expected that my sister would not be able to empathize withe me, but i am hurt by how blind she really is to it, becouse earlyer that week she asked me to explain exakly to her why i couldent get up untill 2pm becouse mabey she could understand it.

So this is me sharing my story along with things that really helped me in particular.\\nFor most of my life I would have described myself as a happy, optimistic person. Good family, good friends, good life in general. That\\'s not to say my life was free of any emotional hardship. Specifically relevant were a couple of times I think I had a couple brief encounters with shorter term depression. In 7th grade there were a few weeks where I was very low emotionally. Feelings of not fitting in, some weird form of bullying. I remember being at my lockers when someone who was something of a friend came over and asked me if I was alright, and that shocked me into realizing I wasn\\'t feeling alright even though I just deflected with \"I\\'ve just been tired lately.\" That brief encounter kind of snapped me out of the negative mindset I was in. In that instance I think all I needed was to know some of my peers actually did care about me so I\\'ve always been very grateful to that person in a way they aren\\'t aware of. The rest of my middle school and high school experience was very good overall. The other brief encounter was just a random day during my freshman year of college. I got back to my dorm after classes on a beautiful Friday. So much stuff that I could potentially do, outside activities with friends, online videogames with friends from high school and elsewhere, any number of campus activities. I sat down and was just overwhelmed with this immense feeling of *boredom.* All this opportunity at my fingertips and none of it appealed to me at all. In fact in that moment it felt like there wasn\\'t anything in the world that would stop this feeling of boredom and that quite nearly brought me to tears. This actually scared me afterwards and over the next few weeks there was an uptick in me going and doing things I thought were productive and fun to make sure I didn\\'t feel that feeling again. I was not so lucky as to avoid it forever.\\nFlash forward to the start of my senior year of college. I had just wrapped up a typical summer working hard, spent some time camping with my family, and was excited to be back to classes. My friends and I had founded a new club at the university, the classes themselves were engaging, and everything was going great. A couple months in and things just started to, I don\\'t know, slip. The fun of anything I was doing just started to fade out slowly and because of this I started to withdraw from doing them. Less and less attentive with the club, less attentive with my social life, less attentive with classes, less attentive with physical fitness. By the end of the semester everything had *really* slipped, including my grades, and I just felt really burnt out on everything. I kept telling myself that winter break would be the recharge I needed. Some time to relax and refocus. Of course I didn\\'t fully comprehend my situation at the time and was totally wrong. Over winter break I had gone back home and spent a large amount of time sleeping/resting. Even when I was awake I really wasn\\'t doing much. At one point I had gone down for yet another nap and my mom came down and asked me if anything was wrong. She noticed the slip in my grades, the sleeping, etc. When she did that it made me briefly aware that something was indeed wrong even if I didn\\'t know what, but I of course deflected it to just being burnt out from last semester and trying to rest up. By the end of break I told myself that I should have my energy back to really finish strong.\\nFor the first month or two of the semester I came out swinging. I was extremely on top of everything, ahead on all my work and getting good grades on it all. Back to my normal gym routine. And yet I had this feeling that I was still just *behind* and despite how well I was doing, just unfulfilled. This was making me uncharacteristically anxious and would cause me to suddenly feel extremely tired. The tiredness led to slipping on things, missing classes and assignments more and more frequently. Eventually I had stopped going to classes altogether. Shortly after this I had started regularly crying myself to sleep, each time this happened pushing me closer and closer to calling my parents and breaking down to them. They beat me to the punch when I got a knock on my door and it was a police officer doing a wellness check because I hadn\\'t responded to my parents for awhile. I broke down on the spot. The officer was very respectful and polite and encouraged me to call my parents, and left shortly after I called them. The next day my mom was out at my university, which was no small trip as it was 1,600 miles from home.\\nThe rest of the week was a whirlwind that shot my stress through the roof. A lot of this was necessary, some of it felt overbearing. I remember getting texts from various people wanting to talk and feeling so exposed, as if my mom had just outed me to everyone regardless of what she actually told them to trigger these responses. She wanted to constantly be around me even though I told her repeatedly that I wasn\\'t going to self harm and didn\\'t feel alone (both completely true), and the lack of space didn\\'t help anxiety levels. However she also pushed me towards all sorts of necessary meetings. With the Dean of Students, with Student Counseling, with professors, with Student Health. Student Counseling, at least at first, was somehow the least considerate of my situation. I remember that meeting clearly, the lady doing the consulting talking to my mom and giving off a vibe as if she thought I was just slacking off in my studies due to poor work ethic and distractions. She did a 180 when I actually started talking about the gradual fade of enjoyment from virtually everything, voice quivering while I was not very successfully fighting back tears, and immediately recommended me to Student Health. The doctor I met with there was much more considerate and recognized the depression right away. More tears were shed, this time from fear, as I faced the realization of being prescribed and SSRI and becoming aware of just how much my situation had escalated. With consultation from the Dean of Students, I did an All-Withdrawal, packed/stored my things, and flew back home.\\nThe next year or so was a rough one, and contained the absolute lowest points of my life. I was a shadow of my former self. Thinking back to that time a lot of it was a blur of feeling empty punctuated by moments of extreme sadness. Even now, when I no longer consider myself depressed, simply thinking of them to type them out has me tearing up, and when I talk about it out loud my voice breaks and I can no longer hold back the tears. The spring/summer which was essentially \"family camping/get together\" season was very tough. Going on camping trips with the fifth-wheel which felt like torture as I laid trapped in a setting that I used to love now forced to realize it gives me no pleasure. Family events where I felt I was only showing up to show-face while spending the rest of the time holding back depressive tears surrounded by loving family and friends. At some point I had started therapy but I wasn\\'t at all consistent with it. Not because it wasn\\'t good or because I had something against it, just because depression had sapped all my self motivation to engage with it. I would still interact with friends but it was extremely taxing. It felt inconsiderate to drag anyone else down with me so I would spend a lot of what little energy I had to still interact positively with people around me. Only a few people really ever saw how I was actually feeling behind it all. I\\'m sure my friends loosely pieced together some extent of things but I doubt they had any idea of the full picture. Like knowing I was subtly lower energy or slightly down in mood, but unaware of the depression specifically.\\n Going to sleep eventually only led to dreams where I also felt depressed. Long nights of crying from the emotional pain and frustration of my situation. Constantly asking myself \"*Why do I feel this way\"* and desperately searching for a solution, hurting more and more every time I came up empty handed. Strangely enough, it was never really self-esteem involved which made it all the more confusing to me. I *knew* there were many people that cared for me, that I was intelligent, that I\\'ve had many good experiences in my life, that I had value as a person. And yet none of that mattered to me and only made it that much more frustrating to feel so miserable. There were a couple of months where I hit my personal rock bottom. I had fully disengaged from everything in my life, I couldn\\'t even muster the energy to so much as play a video game. For about two weeks things got exceptionally bad. I was never actively suicidal or thought about self harm, but during those two weeks and maybe some surrounding them I felt to be what I consider passively suicidal. I no longer actually cared to be alive. I hurt all day, and hurt in my dreams. The only relief I had was unconsciousness between REM cycles. I wasn\\'t going to kill myself, but the idea of just falling asleep and not waking back up, or just withering away to nothing, appealed greatly to me (It took me awhile to type that sentence because of all the powerful feelings it brings up even just thinking about it). For those two weeks I did almost absolutely nothing but lay in bed, either staring at the ceiling or trying to sleep. I barely ate or drank at all, some days not eating anything and the others likely less than 500 calories. If my parents came to check on me, I\\'d quickly pull out my phone and make it appear as if I was at least doing something minuscule then immediately putting it away as soon as I was out of their attention. Maybe in some way I really needed to hit this point, as shortly after began the slow climb out of the pit of my depression.\\nI don\\'t know exactly what it was, maybe just absolutely crippling boredom, but one day not long after that two week period I decided to go back and play a videogame I had started but never finished. May also be in part to having decided to be more consistent with taking my prescribed SSRI (which I had not been at that point). To me this was the moment things began to improve, albeit slowly. It wasn\\'t much, but it was infinitely better than passively killing myself. I slowly started to reengage over the next few months with very basic things like videogames and some of the online friends associated with them, with TV shows/movies, streams etc. I still largely felt numb while engaged with these things, none of it felt satisfying or truly enjoyable but it at least distracted me from some of the pain. Soon my younger sister still in high school started having late night practices multiple times a week which I would provide rides for. Because I didn\\'t want to waste the gas to drive home just to drive back down and then back again (10 miles from the house to the school) it was an easy way to work the gym back into my schedule. Soon I was being much more consistent with my therapy sessions and SSRI use. I was engaging more with my friends. As things shifted into the summer I wasn\\'t feeling nearly as low even if I still wasn\\'t experiencing any happiness. I felt stable enough to take an online class to further my already almost finished degree. To me this actually highlighted the current issue I was facing at the time. I was completing everything on time or earlier, getting almost perfect grades, and not feeling exceptionally sad or stressed. However, I was extremely apathetic. An \"A\" on a paper or assignment felt meaningless, zero satisfaction where I felt it could have been an \"F\" for all it mattered to me. This scared me a lot, and I started reading Reddit *a lot* looking for all sorts of different perspectives on life/activities, desperately hoping to find one that appealed to me. And while I learned a lot in general about many different things, the true way out of my depression came from self reflection.\\nAt some point I resigned to my apathy/anhedonia. Never feeling pleasure was a tough pill to swallow but it was considerably better than emotional pain bringing me to tears on a daily basis. Once I accepted it is when things started to drastically change, because I started treating it almost like a super power. I was just so impartial to everything that in the same vein that otherwise enjoyable activities did nothing for me, otherwise boring/tedious/demanding tasks did nothing either as apathetic boredom was the staple of everything I did. So I figured if I can\\'t be happy I could at least be productive. Took a part time job, upped my gym/fitness routine back to normal, started to live with my grandmother whom, at 93, needed constant help around her house and with errands. She was (Passed 3/4 of a year ago now) an incredibly strong woman and one of my biggest role models, and at the same time could be incredibly finicky and stubborn to the point that she would rapidly wear down the patience of her three daughters. I\\'ve always been an extremely patient person and my \"newfound\" apathy made me perfectly suited to help her on a constant basis. At some point I had also stopped taking any SSRIs (without letting anyone know), as they had helped me get out of that extreme low point but now I had my physical energy and all they were doing was giving me restless energy with no impact on my state of mind. Eventually I transitioned from weekly therapy sessions to biweekly. I stopped drinking soda entirely, not that it was really limiting my health, I just figured I got no pleasure from it so now\\'s the best time to drop an unhealthy part of the diet. While I still couldn\\'t feel pleasure and that I was largely just unsatisfyingly going through the motions of life I did feel as though I proved I was stable enough to return for my last semester of college at the start of the next year. My parents and therapist agreed with me, maybe even more so after I revealed to them that I had taken myself off the SSRIs months beforehand and remained increasingly stable.\\nGoing back out to college I had fiercely crafted a productive routine consisting of very little besides classes/studying, exercise, eating, and sleep. About 8hrs of sleep, 5hrs of exercise (Combination of yoga, weight training, swimming, and running), 3hrs of eating (To maintain high enough calories for all the exercise), 6hrs of class/studying, and 2hrs of free time per day (More free time on the weekends). Every day was packed but it was easy to keep moving as long as I stayed moving because there wasn\\'t anything that I actually *wanted* to do that could distract me. I was also going to group therapy twice weekly, and this is something that I think benefited me immensely even now. A lot of CBT along with just being able to talk and share experience with others directly that really aided my ability to feel comfortable with being vulnerable. I became aware that *inactivity* was a trigger for my depressive feelings. Because I was so apathetic, if I \"stopped moving\" there wasn\\'t really any motivation to \"start moving\" so to speak, which made the weekends the more dangerous days of the week. It was also a fine balance of trying to determine whether or not it was physical/mental exhaustion that legitimately required rest, or simply depressive/apathetic thoughts pretending to be the same thing. I had created a mental image of a physics block diagram that had all the factors of my internal motivation and how depression fit into that. Spring break almost caused me to slip out of things entirely due to the sudden week+ long void in my routine, and the after effects were still felt for a few weeks. Luckily the gains in vulnerability paid huge dividends with getting myself back on track successfully.\\nEven more optimistic, I had started to get a number of very brief breakthroughs against the anhedonia. The first one almost brought me to tears. I was finishing my last lap on the track and *really* pushed myself on the last sprint and felt a deep internal focus and drive I hadn\\'t felt felt for a long time. I wasn\\'t just pushing myself to be productive, I was pushing myself because I *wanted it.* I probably would have broke down and cried on the spot but I fought back the tears because I was still at the gym. The second time was during a night run and as I came up over a hill I looked over the town lights from above and at the big starry sky and felt the cool air and just had the brief feeling of legitimate happiness. Something I hadn\\'t experienced in over two years by that point. Because I was all alone I didn\\'t even fight the tears this time around and just let them flow as I continued my run. Another time was when I had just got done with my evening yoga and was on the way back to my place listening to some comedy online radio station. It was just some dumb joke but I actually laughed out loud at it, which stopped me in my tracks because I realized I actually *enjoyed* it. Each of these little moments were fleeting, only maybe a couple seconds, but they were so incredibly powerful to me. They are still incredibly powerful to me, I was in tears yet again just typing them out here. It truly put things into perspective for me of just how starved for happiness I was, and I clung to those tiny moments intensely.\\nThe next and maybe biggest challenge was still just down the road. While I finished the semester with a strong GPA and walked at commencement, I still had to take a summer field course. This meant no access to group therapy. Camping out in remote locations working on stressful assignments with little in the way of all they typical comforts from home. This would last for nearly two months. I won\\'t lie, it did make me quite anxious. It was testing a lot of skills I had learned prior to my two year break from school and it was a sharp change to go from two group therapy sessions a week to none while removing comfort and increasing stress. And really it turned out to be just what I needed. About 2-3 weeks in I was starting to regularly experience freedom from my depression. Much longer lasting moments of happiness as a more frequent occurrence. Anxiety driven by Imposter Syndrome subsiding as I started doing exceptionally well on each project. Not that my emotional well being wasn\\'t being tested. There were nights in my tent that I had felt very low and resulted in crying. My grandmother that meant so much to me passed away three weeks into it (I still got to talk to her on the phone that same day). And even though these challenges came at me it was just more and more proof that I could process them effectively and not get caught in a downward spiral. I finished with straight A\\'s across each section and felt *satisfaction* finally. I knew somewhere in the field course experience the grip of depression had finally loosened and I felt I was starting to get some space to live.\\nFlash forward to now and I feel as though that grip is gone almost entirely, save for in my memories. It\\'s tough to say when I actually felt totally over it. Not quite right at the end of the field course but also before the last few months where my life has actually been going exceedingly well. I do know that it will always be a part of me, an incredibly important part of me at that. It\\'s something I think about quite often, and doing so typically brings tears quite easily. But they aren\\'t tears of sadness or feeling weak, rather tears of knowing the strength that I had to fight a war with such an insidious opponent and come out victorious. I even sometimes think now that I\\'m grateful for it all in retrospect, as I am so much stronger of a person because of it. That if I had the opportunity to go back to the start and magically prevent the depression from ever occurring in the first place, I wouldn\\'t. I know my situation was considerably less severe than that of many others out there. People driven to self harm or suicidal thoughts, depression that has lasted much longer and/or that has been coupled other terrible things like abuse/anxiety/bipolar/etc. But I do think that regardless of when you find your way out of it all (And you will), eventually you\\'ll look back at it with a strange fondness for all of the strength and growth it gave you. How positively it shaped you in the long haul, even if positivity is a far off concept for you now like it was for me. To maybe help some people along this path I\\'d like to share some things that worked really well for me and hopefully they can for you too:\\n* **Please, please, please, get help!** This is not a battle you want to be fighting by yourself. I assure you that there are so many people that want to see you get better and help you in doing so. Many can be complete strangers. For me it was my direct family, my grandmother, my friends (Even if they didn\\'t know the extent of things), my therapist/counselors, and so many random people on Reddit I never even directly interacted with gave me crucial perspective on life when I needed it most. Speaking of, I would feel more than happy to be one of those people to help anyone struggling so don\\'t hesitate to message me if you want to talk.\\n* **Vulnerability.** This goes hand in hand with getting help. You are **NOT** weak for being vulnerable. You are **NOT** weak for seeking help. Vulnerability is one of if not *the* greatest strength I have taken away from my experience with depression and what has helped me the most when fighting back against it. Just openly talking about my feelings with others in group therapy was liberating, as was openly listening and accepting the vulnerability of others. When I think back to my lowest points I felt so incredibly weak, but when I think about the moments where I vocalized and shared those feelings I feel so strong.\\n* **Therapy**. Undoubtedly what ultimately got me through it all. Both one on one therapy and group therapy worked very well for me. Everyone can be different though. You yourself might respond better to one type or the other, with one style of therapist or another, with a certain personality of the therapist, with a certain frequency of visits. It\\'s important to spend the time finding the fit that works the best for you. And this fit can change for you over time. I felt like I had kind of capped out on one-on-one therapy on a biweekly basis after a certain point and switching to group therapy at 4x the frequency benefited me greatly. However I needed that one-on-one time to even get to a point where the group therapy could be beneficial to begin with. For you it might be the opposite, or it might just be wildly different. Whatever you feel comfortable with and works.\\n* **Medication.** The idea of being put on an SSRI was terrifying to me in a lot of ways. It crystallized the severity of my situation and the idea of taking drugs to intentional alter my mind was not appealing to me. I had an off and on relationship with my consistency taking them. It was definitely necessary to get out of the lower depths of my depression. And as my depression evolved so did my medication needs. If I was more consistent with my medication it might have sped along my journey. While going off of them towards the end was ultimately the right call it was admittedly quite risky to do that without consultation first and I would not recommend my behavior in that case. Like therapy, it is very important to find that \"right fit\" of medication, whether it is none at all or some developed combination of SSRIs you and you psychiatrist have determined over time.\\n* **Engagement.** As depressive thoughts would take hold of me I would disengage more and more from different things in my life. It always felt easy, even like the right thing to do, under the excuse of \"just being tired.\" In reality it was the opposite, I wasn\\'t *truly* tired, and the more I disengaged the easier it was to get pulled by depression. It was slowly reengaging with things, even if the happiness was gone from them or diminished greatly, that triggered my recovery and eventually led to moments of lucidity long term. That\\'s not to say you should just jump back to everything in your life all at once. I know that would have overwhelmed me and cause more of a backslide. Just a gradual reintroduction of things you used to enjoy and maybe some new things you\\'ve found along the way. Maybe a simple routine and some light responsibility that you can steadily add to as you feel comfortable. Things to keep you moving and not trapped in place where depression wants you.\\n* **Positive Reframing.** If I had to mark the point where I really started to fight back against depression it would be when I reframed how I thought about my anhedonia. I found the silver lining to what otherwise felt like an incredibly hopeless situation. Making peace with potentially never being able to obtain happiness again so I could then focus on at least being productive. Like I mentioned before, I became mindful of it almost as a super power. I couldn\\'t do anything to make myself happy so I no longer concerned myself with that. On the flipside I could do incredibly boring but highly productive things seemingly endlessly and not feel any different than doing something I would have otherwise enjoyed. My happiness was no longer in my direct control so I put my attention on what was, and that was productivity. \\n* **Smiling.** This last one might sound a little weird, but sometimes its the small and odd things like this that can really help someone. I was doing a lot of outside work during cold winter months and was frequently wearing a facemask. At some point I started just putting an almost loony smile on my face underneath as I worked without fear of looking like a weirdo and without actually feeling happy either. Overtime it did feel as though just doing that would lead to small upticks in mood. Nowhere near happy but it added to the slowly building positive buffer keeping me from sinking back down.\\nSo that\\'s my story when it comes to my depression, from start to end. Doing this has been something I had meant to do for awhile now, as far back as when I was only starting to truly overcome it. Some of the most beneficial things to me during that dark time was reading different perspectives of people whom had faced their depression and come out the other side for the better so it only feels right that I pay it forward now. Anything I\\'ve spent thinking about writing this, actually writing this, and shedding tears on this would be immediately worth it if only a single person finds something even marginally useful out of it all. Don\\'t hesitate to comment on this or message me directly if you want to talk. Discussing depression is never going to be a burden to me because I choose not to let it be so. I also encourage others like me, whom have made it out of the tunnel, to share your own experience. Nobody should fight depression alone and I sincerely hope that anyone in that fight right now who reads this realizes even a random internet stranger like me is rallied on your side.', 'text_b': None, 'label': 1}, {'guid': 850, 'text_a': 'Awkward mess : Hello fellow depressed people and supporters.

And it really sucks because I want to express myself, but when the time comes I just stop myself from presenting because I’m too embarrassed of my life to talk about it. \\nI just feel so disconnected from my life day to day.

I don’t even really know what my best life is either, I hardly have any will to do pretty much anything now, and anytime I attempt to do something I want to try, I mess it up and feel worse than if I did nothing at all.  \\nI don’t even feel any fear about dying, the only things I’m scared of are the possible pain, and being sad about the small amount of people who care about me. Which I find pretty stupid since why do I care, I’ll be dead anyways. But I do and the pain and few people I have are pretty much the sole reason for me to stay alive, which I hate since that’s a terrible thing to do to someone. I can’t just hold onto people who care about me to keep me alive for my entire life. Because they won’t be here forever, especially with the way I treat them by being like this. And at the rate that I’m going, I’m not even sure if I’ll fear the pain anymore with how bad I feel, there comes a point where the mental pain is bad enough to outweigh any physical pain. I’m even kind of getting there now, I don’t really get VERY sick, but any time I do get sick I highly prefer that to any of the mental things I go though.  \\nI started a medication a few weeks ago, and I’m not sure if it’s just because I can’t handle things well and haven’t had to deal with real side effects in my life so far, but it went **bad** for me. I was pretty tired the morning I took it since I was up all night, after sleeping the day before, so I fell asleep about an hour after I took it. But 3 hours later I woke up in my bed, feeling extremely dizzy just lying down, then I got up and rushed to the bathroom and puked, and I never puke. (The last time I did was probably 5 years ago when I made the mistake of choosing to sit up when I had blood drawn, making me lightheaded and eventually throw up.) And through the rest of the day it was a little difficult to breathe for nearly the entire day, yawning making me unable to breathe at all for around a second, deep breaths too. My face, hands, and feet got very pale during the first few hours after I woke up too, along with random sweating at times. A few other regular physical side effects, and that was that entire day. But still that day I would rate as infinitely better than any of my bad depression days, some days I even have the urge to take one again just for the hell of it. And after that experience, I think that I’m completely done with these medications for depression. This is the third I’ve taken and after 2 previous ones which did absolutely nothing for me, neither regular effects nor side effects, then this, I’m done with them.  \\nI feel like therapy and counselling also can’t help me at all, I’m just not in a mental position for it to do anything of meaning at all. I need things to actually happen, not to sit in a room with someone I don’t even know while they tell me things to do which I don’t feel a will to do at all. I’d need something big to happen to shock me out of this hole I’m in, give me any sort of reason to go on with things. And the weird thing is is I’m not all doom and gloom about everything, I’m not some, “nothing matters, what’s the point of anything, everything’s going to go away anyways” I’m just like, “Okay, and?” about that kind of stuff, I feel no dread or hopelessness about it. I’m a weird person with that, it’s like I’m almost at the point of being content in life, yet at the same time I’m almost at the point of ending everything due to how terrible I feel.\\nSchool for me was pretty much terrible, I don’t remember much about the first few years, but up until around grade 4 I had a few people you could kind of call friends, but even by that point the amount was dwindling. Then I changed schools in grade 5 because we moved, and I did not make a single friend at that school, I hadn’t at my old one since grade 2 either. I did have a neighbour whose house I went to a lot, but honestly, it was all to play games at his house since all we had was a PS2 with a couple games and an N64 with a few games, with a crap computer and absolutely terrible internet. Meanwhile he had a PS3, and a computer that could run games I couldn’t imagine my computer running, so of course I went over there to play games. At school I would spend recess literally just standing or sitting at a wall because I didn’t have a single person I could even call an acquaintance. It got to a point where in grade 7 the teacher told me I could just stay inside for recess, and in grade 8 too after a few weeks. Grade 8 I would probably say is the last good year of my life, I was still very sad a lot of the time, but compared to now I was the cheeriest person on the planet. High school is when shit really hit the fan for me though, I never showed up, I probably missed around a fifth of the days, I missed many many days in school before that, it kept getting progressively worse since grade 4. Grade 9 was probably the weirdest year there, I got much worse than how I was the previous year but I wasn’t anywhere as near as bad as after that. But after 9 things went downhill real fast, grade 10 I failed nearly half of my classes, but due to the way high schools work here I went on to grade 11, but I needed to get those grade 10 credits before I could graduate, and grade 11 I failed *every single class I took* there was not a single credit I gained that year, then I went on to grade 12, which I hardly even had any grade 12 classes for, then I went back for another year, and another year. And by that point I was 18, so I didn’t need to even get all of those credits anymore, all I needed was 7 specific ones from grade 12 to graduate, so I haven’t even properly completed high school like the regular kids. The school never punished me for missing as much as I did either, which certainly set me up for failure with how I view working in my life.\\nAnd I get that I’m just a whiny baby but I cannot think of a single job that I would do and not feel terrible doing. I hear people say, “but when you start making money that’ll get you to do it, so you can do the things you want to do.” but I don’t want to do anything. Having a job to make money would do what? Even if I had something I wanted to do, the amount of stress I’d feel every day from it, making me depressed and anxious constantly would put me in no position to want to do them. And I can’t just “get a job in something I like”, I’m hardly interested in anything in the first place and if I did any of them as an actual job I would almost instantly start to despise it because adding the needs of a job to something I like would make it like anything else. All this makes me feel even worse because what gives me the right to feel like this over something as simple as a job, nearly every single other person has to deal with this shit and just does it, even if it stresses them out they trudge on with it and just do it. But here I am sitting on my ass feeling bad because what, life is stressful? Tough shit, it is for everyone else too, why should I feel like this.\\nNot to mention that I’m trans, even if I sorted every single other thing in my life out, there’s that too, and there’s nothing you can do to get rid of that. And maybe I could have not been if my childhood had been different. I also grew up mostly without a dad, he was in my life for the first few years, but not long enough to form memories, then he came back for around 2 years, but one day just left out of the blue, not a single person knew where he went. So all I’ve had around for most of my life was my mom, she didn’t get with any other guy either so it was just her, me and my brother, who I have a pretty tenuous relationship with. I’d say after my dad left we were solidly lower-middle class, things were pretty hard since my mom got laid-off her job after 20 years when the place closed down, which was not long before he left us. Around age 5, (my dad was gone at that time) my mom dropped me off with someone to babysit me, I remember her being around her late teens or something, I don’t remember much because I was 5. But I do remember that she made me finger her, you know. Even now in text it’s hard for me to say it. But that moment is the most clear memory of my life, especially that far back, I remember the room, what she was wearing, and how confused, weird and awkward I felt from it. When my mom came to pick me up from there I told her and she went livid, rightfully so. I haven’t told her I remember so I think she might just think I forgot about it, but I certainly have not. My mom was also so giving to me too, but I wouldn’t say overprotective because she never kept me from doing things, she just let me do whatever, even when doing whatever was the last thing I needed. You need to discipline your kids, not too much but you need to. I only remember being spanked a few times in my childhood, I don’t even remember what for, my mom once did the classic soap in mouth for swearing, and that got me to never swear in my life until age 11, not so much as a shit or ass left my mouth. But that’s it, I never had chores as a kid, I never had an enforced sleep time, though I did often sleep at the right time at a younger age, but the older I got the later I stayed awake. She never grounded me, never took away anything when I misbehaved, she let me just eat whatever I wanted, which led to me getting very overweight, I’ve gotten less so but, I still am. At this point it’s nothing to do with her anymore, I’m an adult I should get my own shit in check but I just don’t. I get why did this though, it’s just her, since the man she was with for over 20 years and had 2 kids with left without a word, not wanting to be bad to your kids. But there is a difference from treating your kids badly and giving them discipline and teaching them manners.\\nI often wonder if it’s because of all these things that I am trans, maybe I had a certain predisposition to being this way, then with a mom who gave too much, no dad, and being technically molested at around 5 years old, that it made me this way.\\nI feel like my childhood was average, or even better than most in this part of the world, but then I think about how things were, and think, \"well pretty sure that\\'s not a normal thing\" yet I still continue to tell myself it was since my mom was nice to me, probably too much.\\nThis is probably entirely word vomit and I don’t know if I made much sense here, just jumping all over the place, but just need to vent this somewhere, I already make my friends deal with me enough to drop more conversations like this on them.

I'm trying to show that I'm not so happy, but nobody cares. My parents ask me to ask my sister how is she doing if they see she's sad, but it's never been the other way around. All the people I know online are also slowly drifting away since I keep becoming more sad and I talk to them rarely. I had a girlfriend once. It was a random desperate to have a boyfriend type of girl that some people brought to the cinema. Our 'relationship' was empty and lasted roughly 2 months. I didn't take her seriously, she was immature, didn't understand that I'm not extroverted. I didn't care that much when she broke up with me. I tried finding friends online. Even though they were nice to me, offered me to move to them when I finish school so I can have friends, but as I mentioned they never really talk to me first and they began to drift away, because one of them has a girlfriend now. I tried finding a better girlfriend by using tinder (yeah, I know that it was a mistake), but noticed that girls don't talk to guys first. I realised that dating apps are something not for me since I can't begin a conversation. I also realised that I'm not sure whether having a girlfriend would be good for me since I envy them more than I'm into them. That's another thing that makes me sad. It's something commonly described as 'gender dysphoria'. I feel like I don't relate to men and my goals differ. I've decided that I'm not gonna change my gender or anything. It would be a nightmare process. My family would hate me, I wouldn't have any money for that, I wouldn't be even able to go to a therapist since I'm so anxious about going there. I sort of accepted that this thing is gonna make me sad until the end of my life. I also have 0 plans about my future. I'm 18, I'm graduating high school in one year (I'm european so the system is different here) and yet I have 0 hobbies, 0 things I'm good at, 0 social skills or whatever + I'm really anxious about that. The only thing that sometimes makes me happy is alcohol. It may sound like a bad addiction or something, I actually have no issues with it. It just makes me happier and It doesn't bring any negative consequences. There's more to my story, but I'm gonna end it here. I just felt like venting today, because I've never done that before.

I was **wrong**. after discovering how I was talking my aunt proceeded to take me to her house, where she screamed and yelled at me for quite some time about how she was going to \"put the fear of god into me\".

All of elementary and middle school i was bullied i was left out or i had no one to talk to. My mother had talked to the school counselor to get me diagnosed with a form of high functioning autism. I was thrown on random meds to the point that i wasn't able to control myself. I looked like a zombie, i acted like a zombie. Growing up i was never allowed to show my true self, i was always scared to be me. My mother and father fought all the time until they split up when I was 10. My mom moved to Raleigh and took my sister and i with her, she could only afford a duplex in the bad part of town, for all of 6th grade i was the only white boy in my school, i had a target on my back i was always getting into fights or altercations it got bad enough that people would come to my house to try and fight me. There were multiple times where I was getting shot at in the neighborhood I lived in. The police would drive by all the time doing patrols or scouting the area before they did a drug bust. i remember one day after school i had gotten off the bus to walk to my house and all i could see were red and blue lights in front of my house as multiple cops had just busted into my home. I had lost it when i saw swat dragging my mom out in cuffs. After my dad heard about that he had my sister and I moved back in with him. When we got off the plane to live with him we met his new girlfriend, instantly I knew she wasn't good. My dad worked hours away from where he lived so there would be times we would be left alone with her for weeks on end, she had all of these strict rules with harsh punishments almost always she would escalate it to the point of myself or my sister getting swatted with a wooden spoon, hanger, belt, and even a 1x4. There were times where she said she wanted to break a piece of oak over my back side, i remember how i spent more time crying myself to sleep then actually being happy, i wasn't allowed to talk to anyone about what was going on and it had gotten so bad on so many occasions that i was actually scared for my life. I didn't know how i was going to be able to go to school the next day, hell i would rather go to school then be home and school wasn't much better for me, i was always alone, i had no friends and i had no one to talk to. I would always have to run out of class crying because something small had happened that would upset me. Growing up i could remember multiple times where i wanted to die, where i thought that was the only way out of the misery i was going though. I had attempted to take my own life on multiple occasions. I had tried 2 times before i was 10, once i tried to overdose, again i had used a string as a noose. When i was 17 i tried again but this time i had a gun to my head. I had almost fully depressed the trigger but something stopped me. I can't explain the feeling but my body almost felt as though i was overtaken by an outside force. There's times I sit there and wish that I had pulled the trigger, times I wish I wasn't alive anymore, when I was in the school house I had gotten so overwhelmed that I had to leave my room. It was a wednesday evening around 11 or 12pm, the duty nco was doing his rounds checking the building. He saw me sitting on the stairs and instantly knew something was wrong, he said the last time he saw someone with the expression i had on my face they had killed themselves. Growing up I was always down and sad. It takes me a minute to think of something that made me smile, it's not hard for me to think of something negative that happened when i was growing up since that's 90% of what happened when i grew up. Hell there's multiple times where my step mother had called the cops on me because she didn't want to “deal” with me. No matter what happened I would get punished, my sister ran away from home and I was the one who suffered the consequences because I didn't stop her. I would always cry myself to sleep if i could fall asleep. Now every time someone raises a hand at me I flinch, not because I'm scared but out of reflex. Id always feel more comfortable away from everyone being alone because i was scared i'd do something to get in trouble. I never went out growing up and i didnt have any friends I was close to. I still have problems talking to people. I have problems telling people how i feel or expressing my emotions. I remember after my stepmother had called the cops on me and when i was back home from the hospital she had me sit down at the dining room table every day from sun up to sun down writing 4 sentences over and over again. Every day after school i would have to sit there and do homework. After I finish my homework I'd have to start writing. I ended up writing all 4 sentences 1000 times each. The only way I was allowed to move was to ask if i could use the bathroom. On the weekends she'd make me get up at 7 to sit down there and start writing. And i'd sit there up to 10pm. And every time I tried to talk to someone about it she'd either deny it all together or she'd say that I was overreacting. I was all the time getting screamed at, cussed at and belittled saying i would never be good enough, id never do anything with my life or id never do anything to matter. That i would end up being some low life piece of trash. I spent more time in my room away from everyone then trying to socialize because i was scared of human interaction. I didn't tell my dad about my first girlfriend until after we broke up because i was scared that he would disown me. I never had someone i could go to to talk about things with.

I want a dog. \\nThings that haven’t changed since then: I still have the thoughts, nobody can tell, I’m stressed and I’m always planning my suicide at the back of my mind.\\nI’m happy. Or I’m supposed to be. I have many friends, whom I love. They make me laugh. I went out with them on the weekend, first time in a while when I have ever gone outside. It was really fun. We ate and watched a movie (Sonic - came out yesterday, well two days ago since it’s 12:40am). And then I came home and realised that I was scared to feel really down again and did everything I could to prolong my happiness. I focused on this topic, talked about how great the movie was and what we did etc. And then I slept and woke up miserable. It was good while it lasted. \\nI think I might’ve fooled myself into this. I keep thinking about it and I could’ve tricked myself into believing I was depressed or something. I don’t really know.\\nI have thought about suicide. But I don’t know if I could do it. One thing that made me doubt it was when a meme was shared on our group chat. It was something like ‘5 types of friends’ and  the depressed one came up. We were all making jokes about it, me included, and deciding who was who. One of my friends said that I definitely couldn’t be the depressed one, along with her and another. That had me thinking, first : damn, I’m a good actor. Then: none of them really know. If I killed myself, it would be a massive surprise. I don’t know if I could do that to them. Since then, I’ve tried to leave a couple of hints but they weren’t really good hints and weren’t picked up. That sucked. I want them to know it wasn’t their fault but I don’t want to leave a suicide note. I would be expected to explain my actions and if I survive, it would make my life a living hell. \\nI also have one friend, who could be extra vulnerable or saddened by my sudden death. She has admitted to every one that she has struggled with depression and suicidal thoughts but isn’t diagnosed because her family don’t have enough money for a psychiatrist. I’m kinda jealous that she was able to confess everything to this group of people she wasn’t super close with. I can’t even confess to my sister and I’ve know her my whole life. The confession seemed sincere and I had noticed she was a bit distant some days. So it is believable. And I don’t want her to do the same thing. \\nI also don’t know how. An overdose on pills probably won’t kill me and I don’t go outside much so I don’t have many ideas for a bridge to jump off. I always have the urge to kill myself whenever something slightly wrong happens. Like saying something weird or embarrassing at the time or doing something stupid. That’s why I tend to make a lot of jokes and surreal crap, I don’t focus on it because it makes literally no sense and other people found it funny too. \\nI’m tired of this and it’s 1am now.

Scissors, knifes, and I switched to those dumb led pens.  I tried to stop myself from being around those things. I'm not very closed about my Depression as I should be. That's good I guess. I'm open to everyone about it. Even the girl I like knows this shit. I Have social anxiety but I can handle talking to her and stuff like that, but not tell her I Like her. I'm off topic. Any way. THey closed my school for the month because of the Corona Virus pandemic, It just made it's way to louisiana. I;m a bit scared of it. But At least I'll be apart of something. Not to mention more people recover than die from it, so I'mma be fine. ( nd I am in the age group that is more likely to get it.)  \\nAnd I Think Everything happens for a Reason. So I would normally take in to account Every single possible scenario and think of a way out. Or a way to avoid it.  But Being away from my band members, and away from asking the girl i like out, and maybe never finding love got me into serious depression. I don't believe in the thing everyone has someone. Because of my philosophical thinking...\\nSo I used the sharpest knife i have and Stabbed my hand. Obviously, It left a big mark.  So I've been Hiding it from My mom. I don't want to hear her Christion Bull shit. Or her yelling how dumb I am for stabbing my self with no reason. So I've been taking advantage of the pandemic and told my mom I felt sick. She Was A Little paranoid of the Corona outbreak and remembered the pamphlet that the school Brought home with out report cards. All sick people should stay in bed to rick the possible outcome of getting the COVID-19 virus. \\nI'm smart In thinking of a way to out smart my mom. And Take advantage of things like that, (Btw, I take a bath every night, so whipping the blood off was extremely easy, and me not being a fucking dumbass, I know how to apply bandages and shit like that. I treated the mark like any other, A Shit ton of rubbing alcohol, and bandages. Funny thing After all the blood and stuff washed away, It wasn't as big as I thought.)  My depression Is slowly turning into loss of sanity. \\nAt least I could use that in my band since I write the lyrics, and I Play the bass. I Can really control the band. There's a reason I call us the Drop Of The Psychos.  ( I have the stage name Psycho. Kinda weird to have a stage name and be proud of the name then being made fun of. They used to call me Psycho when I would Scream or make random outbursts.)  \\nI don't know where my sanity is going, but I know it's not helping a single thing. Except when I act on impulse, like stab my self I feel happy. Only TIme I've ever did. Any time I do what I feel like, I laugh or smile.

I’m the stubborn kind, specially when it comes to issues concerning myself or people that I love - I seem to always think I know exactly what’s wrong and how it can be fixed. So much so that a week ago I decided it was better to go to the ER to get a very minor symptom checked rather than waiting to go to my family doctor the next day. I went to them three times the same week because I was worried about my fucking bowel movements .. so unaware of my tendency to project my mental struggles on my body.  \\nThe funny thing about all of this is that if someone had pointed that out to me I would’ve denied it without a second thought, not wanting to believe that I like to concoct scenarios that stray my own attention away from my real struggles. \\nSo that’s why I decided to write. To gain some clarity for myself for once. No bullshit, just unfiltered thoughts pouring out of me.. \\nand halfway through was when it clicked for me.\\nThe times my parents had tried to get me out of bed, to get me up for school, or the texts I’d receive throughout the day from my closest friends asking where I was and why I wasn’t there.. it became clear that they all knew way before me how horribly depressed I was. I wasn’t fooling anyone except myself.\\nI couldn’t get help because I didn’t know how to admit to myself how badly I wanted to mute the thoughts in my head. How I didn’t know how to trust myself or my opinions, my values, my emotions. So many times id rather not feel anything than to feel something because I thought my emotions were so invalid, minuscule and unimportant . \\nAnd I was so sure everyone felt the same way.\\nIt’s crazy to think how many people I’d use as anchors to enable these shitty views of myself and my self esteem. I liked to focus on other people because that way I could ignore my own inability to express what I felt and how I dealt with myself.. which was doing absolutely nothing. I’d do nothing for my own good.. I’d do it for the sake of my parents or my friends or my growing hunger for stability. It was always a race to see how far I would make it before collapsing into my bed for three days straight with my lights off and often a show in front of me or a book in my hand , telling myself I’d deserved the break because I’d exhausted myself the week before it - and that was true. My highs are always filled with days of me spending time outside and with my friends. School and work and parties and hangouts .. anything that would stop me from going home. That’s what I love, and also what I hate when I crash. Because that’s when I overthink every detail of my life. From my acne prone skin to my too skinny face or my slanted nose, how’d I’d looked in a picture or how I’d reacted to a situation . All running through my head at a speed that would be exhausting , so I’d rather turn it off by focusing on something or someone else , fictional or non fictional. \\nI guess that’s also when I developed my eating disorder. When I would refuse to eat even a bite, lay in bed and starve because I’d eaten “too much” the past week. I’d spent my meal points for the week so I had to make up for it somehow, right? How else could I keep the only redeeming quality about myself? How else could I justify the amount of times I’d kneeled on the washroom floor to hurl after a night out? All that work couldn’t go to waste of course. \\nI was so blind to it all. I used to think I had a “digestion problem” and that’s what I would get “nauseous” after every meal.. it was better to relieve it than to deal with the nausea the entire day.. wouldn’t you agree? \\nYet again, I’m sure the only one I was able to keep fooled was myself. \\nI hope my point didn’t get lost in between all my ramblings. this is the real danger of writing purely and without any filters - sometimes you forget what you wanted to get to in the first place. I guess what I want to get at is how so incredibly relieving it became once I saw it for myself. Without the beer goggles on, without the denial clouding my judgement. I needed help. I took a long time to get it because I thought I could work out my “laziness”. But I never did. Not until I got some time for myself without worrying about school or maintaining an A1 social life.

And yet, time and time again, something holds me back. Such a terrible thing, conscience, how it keeps me caged and wanting. I’m a man on borrowed time, when is it going to run out?\\nMaybe I was never meant to survive my birth. The privilege certainly belongs to greater men and women than I—my brother and my sisters, for one. Perhaps they would have loved being alive. Loved it better, stronger, far less selfishly.\\nAngel. *Messenger of God.*\\nMary Grace. *Beloved; to thank.*\\nBryan. *Noble.*\\nPerhaps they would’ve cherished it, their names, and not grow to hate it—and the ones who gave it to me, just a little—like I have. Perhaps they would’ve been happy and sometimes I think that I’m simply the result of their frustration from never really having the chance to live. After having fought so hard to exist, mine seems like a bitter sigh mistakenly given form after they have finally given up; there’s enough spite, I believe, to justify it.\\nIf they’re with me, I’d like to say that I admire their efforts to remain. The first few years of my life were naive yet blissfuly full of wonder and hope. Far too many for a single child, sometimes, but maybe I wasn’t. I just wish they experienced their lost childhood in a better way, for far longer, before I inevitably destroyed even that.\\nLight may filter down onto shadows but definition demands that only one of them exists in a single space at a time. Where there is light, there is no darkness; where there is darkness, there is no light. Similarly, though they may occupy me for a time, it’s obvious that their hold is not everlasting. I exist too.\\nI miss their presence. They could’ve been happy and by extension, maybe I could’ve taken a little of that happiness for myself. Stored it away, deep down, for when it needs to be there before possibility becomes *it is done*.\\nI do wish to be happy, though I’m slowly realising that it’s less about opportunity and more about capacity. Maybe it’s my fault, maybe it isn’t. But then I never really do anything about it so maybe it is, after all.\\nOur counsellor said that I should stop thinking about it. Would you believe that it actually works? Of course, it does sear a little deeper, a little more violently each time but it does remove its immediate presence.

Ever since my parents have been looking at me differently, I’ll notice side glances, I feel like they wish I was straight. My sister has always been in my corner, even against our own parents. She’s always supported me, and I am so proud of how far she’s come in life.\\nIf I can’t feel comfortable as myself around my parents, who can I then? I found respite in a relatively new friend. He and I relate on a lot of things. Ever since we started having serious conversations, we’ve become each other’s emotional dumping grounds. We’ve been kind of charging each other up into a big bomb, I don’t mind if I get caught in the explosion.\\nI look at our relationship and I know it isn’t healthy for either of us. You know how there are somethings you don’t talk about with people? We don’t have that, we can go from memes to our sexual traumas in less than 5 minutes. We kind of mesh in the least healthy way possible. \\nI’m an extremely anxious and depressed person, I’ll spend days on end locked in my room alone. I’m not going to air out my friend’s business because that’s not my place. We lock into each other like puzzle pieces. We’ve been openly plotting our suicides together. It feels great to talk about planning on dying without hearing “you’ve got your whole life ahead of you”, for context neither of us are even 19, neither of us are younger than 17. \\nI’ve noticed something about myself that’s kind of been eating at me lately. With how much time we spend talking to each other. I think I might be developing feelings for him? Idk, I’ve just been feeling so validated because someone finally listens to what i have to say without judging me. He makes my chest feel tight, and that upsets me. I know nothing can happen between us because neither of us will be alive long enough for something to flourish. \\nI just know that when my time comes, I’m going to shred my arm with my razor blades and fade out messaging him, if he’s still alive when I do it.\\nI fell back into cutting, and I’ve been fucking destroying my thighs over the last week after stealing a 100 pack of razor blades. My most recent cuts are from 10 minutes ago now. It’s developed into a sort of addiction I think. I’ll be moodier than usual all day because I’m looking forward to the night so I can lock myself in the bathroom and destroy my body without being interrupted. I’m literally planning my days around my release at night. \\nI tried to overdose recently, that puts me at attempt 3. I hope 4 is much more effective, because I’m tired of feeling empty.\\nEven before my family knew I was gay I was still the black sheep. Mainly because of my interests. I’ve always had an affinity for the occult and true crime. I feel like my parents focused more on my other siblings rather than me. My older brother was always screaming and trying to fist fight my dad, he would punch holes in walls and try to manipulate us. My younger sister got attention because she was the youngest. Because of my brother, loud noises and arguments freak me the fuck out.\\nI was unremarkable and I didn’t cause problems. So I guess I faded into the back while they took up their time. \\nI had to grow up fast and I feel like I was robbed of a childhood. I was molested by my cousin for years through my adolescence. Which fucked up my current sex life. I don’t like being touched in certain areas. Makes me cry and have anxiety attacks. It was happening like 30 feet away from my entire immediate family, always behind that same bush at my grandparents’ home. It’s not like she didn’t know that it was fucked up, she was old enough to know that fondling someone when they’re saying no is wrong. I still feel small when I think about it, I feel small and scared and helpless. \\nShe still tries to text me, the last time I saw her was 8 months ago I believe. Nobody except for my friend knows what she’s done to me. \\nTyping that out made me want to slice the artery in my thigh. \\nHonestly the only good thing I’ve got so far this year is my friend. Maybe under different circumstances, if we weren’t so fucked up, maybe there could be something between us.

I want to try and sum up in a few paragraphs what depression means to me and how I’ve learned to deal with it and understand it. \\nIf the cause of our depression is out of our control, we have to try and acknowledge the fact that life will throw us curve balls, takes the wind out our sails and pull the rug from under our feet when we least expect it. It’s not about what happens to us it’s about how we deal with it that matters.\\nMy depression has been caused not by uncontrollable life events, but by my own stupidity, my own poor decisions, my own silly behaviour, my own horrific mistakes. My sadness was caused by nothing but myself. This is a much more bitter pill to swallow but can still be fixed over time. \\nHowever our depression came about, it is our brain that is overwhelmed by negative thoughts. Be it anger or self hate, suicide or self harm, past distresses or consequences. Negative thoughts are playing on a loop in our brain, the longer we allow the negative thoughts to continue the harder it will be to emerge from our depression. \\nI know, trying to tell a person with depression to think positively sounds like a load of bullshit right? But introducing positivity is the only thing that will work. We have to try and see a positive way forward, where we exercise and eat nutritious food. Where we hang out and laugh with friends. Where we start to love and care for the people around us or picture ourselves with a new partner and finally move on from that emotional break up. \\nFor me, when I’m at my lowest I would lose my appetite and wouldn’t go to the gym. I would lose muscle mass and start to look skinny. When I did eat it was just junk food to make the hunger go away. My sleeping pattern was lost and I had dark circles under my eyes. I stopped cleaning my house and allowed it to get messy and unhygienic. I stopped seeing friends and family and cancelled plans because I looked horrific. My job suffered and my finances took a hit. \\nNo matter how bad things appear we should try to remain positive in the important areas of our life. Depression will come and go but our health and hygiene can deteriorate quick when we don’t look after ourselves. Building up from rock bottom each time is difficult, try to avoid hitting rock bottom by staying positive enough to look after ourselves well. \\nLaying in a dark room and obsessing over events that happened last week, last month or last year will get us nowhere, a nutritious meal and phone call to a friend will get us somewhere.

I should write on the computer, given what happened, but I\\'m stubborn. \\nYou don\\'t know the rage I\\'m feeling right now, I had written a lot. I was going to let off steam and also tell some things about my life so that you could understand me better, but I give up. This is fucking funny. I don\\'t understand why the hell this happens to me. \\nI can\\'t take it anymore, I\\'m really screwed. Many things have happened to me, and they continue to happen to me. Every year it has gotten worse, one problem has been added after another, and none has been solved. I\\'ve lost count of all the times I\\'ve thought about dying. I know that my problems are not going to be solved, I know that I can never forget everything I have been through. I will not be able to make up all the lost years, nor change the things that happened. Nothing was as I wanted, nothing was as I thought it would be. And I know that my next years are not going to be either, I will have to keep holding on and trying harder than the rest. For what? After all I\\'ve been through, it\\'s no longer worth, even if in the future i have the best life in the world. It is not what I want. All he wanted was to be happy, but it seems that was too much to ask. I have lowered it to just being calm, to be in peace. But again, I ask too much. I have no reason to continue, and I will not live because others want me to. If I live it is because I want to, I will not depend on another person. I have tried and tried to exhaustion. I\\'ve been holding on all my life. People believe that people with depression or who end their lives do not ask for help. Lie. For four years I have been surrounded by people to whom I tell my problems. Social services, psychologists, psychiatrists, my tutor, the institute\\'s educational psychologist. Four years. If in four years a solution has not been found, it is that there is not. And I don\\'t say it, they say it. His \"solution\" is to hold on. They want me to hold on for two more years like this, and then, after two years, i have to continue hold on, and work hard. And for what? I never asked to be born, I did not ask to come into this world, much less suffer all that I have suffered. Sometimes there is no solution. All you can do is hold on, but you know what? I\\'m human, and I have a fucking limit. They want me to live independently of everything I have suffered and I have to continue suffering, isn\\'t that more selfish than taking my life? Even among the fucked-up people, I am the one that is left over, I know from experience. It will always be like this, no matter where I go, no matter if they don\\'t know me, it will be like this, because I have lived it.\\nI\\'m drowning, I can\\'t breathe. I\\'m exhausted, I can\\'t take it anymore. I have no energy left, no desire, no strength. No one can help me, nor can I solve all my problems. I\\'m sunk, I\\'m pissed off, and I\\'m alone. I\\'ve already heard all kinds of messages of support, all kinds of criticism. Neither thing works. There comes a point of no return, and I have already reached it. I spend my days sleeping and distracting myself so as not to think, only for another day to pass. And for what? I know that there are good people, and that there are good things, but they are not worth it. People try not to see reality, because reality is bullshit. It is full of bad people, who screw life to the others. And are we sick? It is easier to convince a person with depression that their thoughts are wrong, that they are wrong because of their illness, that life is really worth it, that things will be solved and that a better future awaits them. That is easier than trying to educate people from a young age, and easier than trying to change bad people. Really, I can\\'t take it anymore, I go on the internet and I get sick, reading comments on Youtube, or on Instagram, or some articles. I get sick, and I can\\'t forget everything I read and everything I see. I know there are people more screwed up than me, who have less than me, who \"complain\" less than me, and still get ahead, or keep trying. I know. So sorry for wanting to die, sorry for not being able to anymore, sorry for not loving life. I just want to rest. \\nI\\'m still able to laugh, or have a good time, but it\\'s not worth it. I really don\\'t know what the hell to do, because I can\\'t take it anymore. And if there isn\\'t a solution already, I can\\'t keep waiting. And I know there is not going to be a solution. The pain and anger I feel is excruciating, and all I do is disappoint everyone. I honestly do not know what I want you to say, because really nothing you say will solve my life or how I feel, nor will it give me hope of continuing to endure or live. It is my body, and it is my life, and I couldn\\'t choose to not be born, but at least I should be able to choose when and how to die. My heart really hurts, I feel sore, I don\\'t know if it\\'s because of stress, exhaustion or suffering. The only thing that makes me a little happy is eating Mc Donald\\'s in my bed while I watch videos, series or movies. But I try not to do it too much because I don\\'t want to get fat, even though that\\'s one of the few things that gives me a little joy. The only reason I haven\\'t killed myself is because I have to get rid of my things and everything I have on my phone, and that costs me. I know that the police or my parents would touch my things and would not respect my privacy. They would care very much to find out things once I died, when in life all they have done is screw me. I have told my life to many people, professional and non-professional, nobody has a solution, or different answers.

I’m sorry I can’t turn you on.” I’ve tried so hard to make him understand, but he doesn’t.

Why haven't I killed myself already? Is anybody gonna read this post anyway? : So many questions, yeah. I think it'd be good to answer them in the order in which they are written. To introduce myself. Hi, my name is Anne and I kinda do like blueberries but that's not the point of this post, so let's get straight to the point.\\nWhat is the **point** of still living (see, I told you we would get to the point)? Many people I know have their future already planned. Which is the best thing that could happen to a person really. You just wanna know where you're going in life. What you wanna achieve. Which job you would like to do one day. Like, everyone of my friends has seemed to know these kinds of stuff for such a long time that it's kinda making me even more depressed. You see, I'm not 18 anymore. I'm turning 25 this summer. This fact is totally crazy cause I'm just way too old for someone that has been wishing to kill herself for such a long time lol.\\nWhich brings me to the second question: Why haven't I killed myself already? Great question, really. The thought of killing myself has been in my mind for quite a while actually. Ever since I got bullied during the elementary schoo, I wouldn’t make a day without thinking how liberating and relieving that act would had been. My life was so shitty at that time that the thought of killing myself one day to end the suffering became the only solution that felt right.\\nThis whole situation became so bad that I started seeing a therapist. Which, at this point, I’m quite thankful for cause if it hadn’t been for him and the pills he had prescribed to me, I wouldn’t have even made it to the end of high school. I was sooo determined to kill myself really, the suffering was just unbearable. Yet, I didn’t do it in the end. But we’re about to get to that later.\\nAnd, I mean, I am the one to blame partly. I have a really unstable personality and it surely is really hard to love me or be my friend. I generally am really kind to people and let them do any bad thing to me if that means they'll still be by my side. It is terrible doing so, I am quite aware of that. But I am often feeling really lonely because of my shyness and social anxiety, so when I start trusting someone, I really am afraid of losing them cause I know I ain’t gonna replace them that easily. \\nLike I said, I am hard to love. I don’t think I’m worth anything to be honest, so I’m always really surprised when anyone actually approaches me and seems to like me. My therapist would have been so upset if he heard me say stuff like that but that’s just how it is. I stopped seeing him quite a while ago when I thought I’m over all this and don’t need him anymore btw. But I guess that I was wrong.\\nOne day, I feel amazing and really happy about my life just to get all depressed and sad the other day (or even the same day, only a couple of hours later lol). I just let myself be hurt by people. Over and over again. Cause it's my fault. On one hand, I know it’s wrong but I just continue letting them do that. I just let my boyfriend treat me like shit sometimes. Cause it's my fault. Plus, who else is gonna love me if he leaves me, right? I just have to endure that. It hurts. But you wanna know what hurts even more? The fact that I can do nothing about it.\\nI’m too scared to be lonely. Some days, I feel like my boyfriend genuinely loves me and cares about me and everything in my life is great. Other days, I just feel like shit, starting to think that killing myself is not that bad of an option after all. It is a great option indeed, yet there’s a tiny little problem. I’m way too scared to do that. If only I had no self-preservation instinct. That shit always stands in my way. It always  felt so right to kill myself but my self-preservation instinct always stood in my way. I am just way too weak.\\nSo here I am. With no future ahead, having to be quarantined because of the corona virus pandemic, which makes my depression ten times worse. I don’t know how long it’s gonna take before I can at least leave my house, but one thing’s for sure. I feel like there’s no future for me and I see dying soon as the only option again. But I'm scared to do that. Again. \\nI am pretty sure that I'm gonna feel better tomorrow and this won't be that much of a problem anymore, but that is what scares me even more. Thoughts like this are always gonna be somewhere in my head just waiting to fire their shot (this expression is probably not used right, but that doesn't matter cause my whole life is trash). And I'm just too scared of the next time they'll come to haunt me. My life is a fucking rollercoaster and I don't find it funny anymore.\\nIs anybody gonna read this post anyway? **Excelent question**, thanks for asking. I don't know. But I feel better having written this down. I don't know why lol. But I just do. So thank you, reddit.\\nIf you did read it till the end though, please don't judge me.

I couldn’t sit and do nothing for any amount of time, I was so afraid my brain would get too loud. but my mind is constantly loud that it overwhelms me and i tend to forget to do the things that were just in my head.

I suffer from depression, anxiety and extremely low self-esteem, that’s probably because of my narcissistic parents. I’m the middle child, i have two sisters. I’m neither the oldest and smartest, nor the youngest and cutest. I’m just nobody. But apparently I’m exceptionally talented in math and physics. Let me explain. \\nWhen I started high school 4 years ago, I had absolutely no I idea who I was. After many years of denying and desperately trying to forget the nights I cried myself to sleep feeling like an orphan. I felt guilty for feeling like that, because i had food, clothes and a roof over my head. My siblings hated me as well, they were always jealous of me. Two years ago i had a severe eating disorder, and all i received from my family was even more hatred. I don’t think i need to explain the horrible effects of narcissistic parents on a child. But they did love my sisters, for a reason that was unclear to me. So i needed to find it out, in order to change myself. You probably guessed that nothing really worked. I must have been so bad, I didn’t even deserve to be loved. I felt like i was worthless. Honestly i still feel like that. \\nMy physics teacher was the first one to tell me otherwise. He said i was talented. He said ’If i will ever have a daughter, I want her to be like you.’. I just couldn’t handle that. If i was so good, why didn’t my own father want me? It confused me. I constantly felt like an impostor, i was afraid that if he would get to know me better, he would find out how bad i am. I felt like i would only disappoint him. \\nI cried several times in school, i cried on his shoulders. He told me about his own narcissistic parents, he told me that he had been an alcoholic like me. One time i was so miserably crying, i noticed tears in his eyes. Generally he was a pretty gruff person, but it all changed when he talked to me. He even offered to land me some money, so i wouldn’t have to work so much. \\nI felt so bad, I didn’t want to let him down. I felt like i didn’t deserve a single minute of the time he gave me. I started skipping his classes. I felt so guilty, i couldn’t even look into his eyes. He once confronted me about it: ’I think i have done much more for you in these 4 years’. \\nWe don’t go to school now because of the coronavirus. I didn’t even say goodbye to him, I don’t know if i would ever see him again. Even if i do, I won’t be brave enough to tell him this.

My dad was abusive to us and my mum but she still believes the Sun shines out of his ass. I used to see him maybe twice a year at times because he lived in another City and fucking left my mum with 5 children to raise all on her own and she was still faithfull to him all those years. My mum made us think he was Superman and it's taken me many years to realize just how much damage he did to us.\\nWe had a very sheltered upbringing. Most of my friends were people I went to school with. I didn't talk to any neighbours or anything. Not having a father figure and being raised mostly by my mum meant that there were certain things about being a man which I had to learn from other men or didn't learn at all. I'm pretty okay-looking but my self-esteem is in the gutters.\\nOn Saturday evening, I was expecting a girl (I met her at work) to come visit me. I knew she liked me a lot because despite her having a boyfriend of 3 years, she still got on the bus. I then started to think about all the discussions that got me to that point. I had lied to this girl from the very first word I spoke to her. I knew what I was doing when I said certain things to make her fall for me. After realizing that the entire image of me she had was a lie, I had a mental breakdown, returned home and told her not to come anymore.\\nNow this is where this shitty feeling of depression comes in...\\nDuring this nervous breakdown, I started to look back on my entire life and I realized that I've been a pathological liar all this while.

Now, started coming back to me and I just realized how stupid I must have looked to everyone.\\nI lied that I had been on holiday multiple times abroad when I had never left the country for one day.\\nI lied about having sex and losing my virginity (this time in University) when I really hadn't.\\nI lied to my coworkers about previously having been a boxer. I've never stepped in a boxing gym in my life.\\nThe lies I mentioned above are just a small fraction of stupid, unnecessary lies I told people. I said these lies to the extent that I started to believe them myself and they became part of me. But I'm sure as hell the people I told these lies to never did which makes me feel even more ashamed of myself.\\nI have so many skeletons in my closet when I did those things, they all seemed normal to me but these past it seems all my mistakes and stupid decisions have come back to haunt me at once. I feel extremely guilty and sad. The world doesn't need people like me.\\nNow I don't even know who I am or what the future holds for me. I don't feel a lying-ass creep like me deserves to have good, fruitful relationships with anyone... Maybe that's why my social life is complete garbage.\\nThe silver-lining to this is that at least now I know the stupid things I used to do and I kind op have an idea of how to make things better for myself.

Moving has been tough though. I had to give up my cat and say goodbye to my friends.\\nI have kind of 'joined' a group of friends at school. They're all pretty nice. The dynamic of the group is a little weird though. Its like 50% introverts who don't talk much, myself included, and 50% strongly opinionated extroverts. They mostly seem like a nice group of people though. In regard to making friends, things have gone pretty well. Trying to form deep relationships with people is a hard and long process though. It's hard not to get impatient and blame myself though. I feel like I'm being ungrateful because even though I think I've been lucky in finding a group of friends, which is exactly what I want, I still feel so shit.\\nI've never been diagnosed but I think I could have depression and/or anxiety.

I've been thinking about it a lot recently. I've been researching pills I can get at a chemist that I could overdose on and I've found a suicide bridge that's very close to my house. I've been told that I should live for all the good moments in life, but the effort it takes to reach those moments doesn't seem worth it sometimes.\\nI'm starting to find it hard to trust myself.

We don't see each other much but she always makes an effort to greet me. I'm unsure whether her intentions are romantic or platonic and it's making me dizzy. I really want us to become better friends or maybe more, but I am not great at social interaction and always make myself feel shit about every little mistake I make.

I was known but never popular. I was the kid that got picked last for sports or games, never got to play soccer with the other kids because I wasnt good enough, wasnt included in tag or hide and go seek, but I pressed on not knowing what the other kids were bullying me. I got to play lego or slap jack, tic tac toe, you name it, I played by myself. I had about 3 or 4 friends for most of primary school (kindergarten-grade 3). Not knowing how to interact with the other kids I was lonely. I didnt realize I was lonely as it was well normal for me. The world was out to get me and I let it, I had no voice. I didnt know how to stand up to myself for fear of hurting the other person for telling them how I felt. I was never taught how to show emotions or how to use them. Interpret them. I know what they look like and how they feel but showing them? Using them? You\\'d have better luck getting a volcano to spew water. But this is how I was brought up and its what I knew. Life for me was like looking through beer goggles for everyone else it was distorted and I had a fake image of what it was. Because of this I matured faster in other aspects of life. I grasped adult concepts earlier than most and grew into them. Into worrying about what others think of me, always comparing myself to EVERYONE else, not just the best or the people above me but everyone. I felt like everyone hated me and thought I was some annoying kid so I shut myself off from the world. That\\'s the first few years of life. I ran around as a \"happy\" lonely kid. As I grew up and was about 10 or 11 I learned to read people and guess what they were feeling/thinking, how their day was going n shit. I learned to feed off of everyone\\'s emotions around me rather than feeling my own. I essentially shut off my own emotions without realizing it and now I\\'m struggling with fixing it. I fed off of the kids that were happy and replicated their happiness as my own, I imitated them and copied them to feel included. I grew up like this trying to fill that big empty lonely hole I felt, i buried it deep down and (as a green swamp friend of mine once said) I became an onion, I made layers to try to hide it but nothing seemed to work. (Sorry this post has kinda became a pity party it was not my Intention, fuck it let\\'s continue) the next couple years of my life pretty much continued on like this, building my wall of fake emotions to \"protect\" everyone else from my greatest enemy... myself, I didnt trust myself to not fuck up, didnt trust myself to really connect with anyone. I lied to everyone around me and pushed anyone away that tried to get close or learn who really was on the inside. It was repulsive and wrong but I didnt know that. I would say this is when I got my first taste of depression around the age of 12. Grades 5-7 I was the class runt/Guinne pig/doormat, I was the kid being bullied. The other kids unanimously decided I was the kid they picked on. Fucking private religious bullshit school did nothing to prevent what they were doing to me nor did they seem to care hell even the TEACHERS  would pick on me. So I accepted \"who I was\" and that was the school fuck up. I tried to take their name tag and wear it with pride. Yea it worked for a bit as armor. I made myself insensitive to the bullying for the first little bit. But grade 6 is when the smack down really started to happen and I became... the germ. These kids had gotten the idea to give me the permanent cheese touch or the germ as they liked to call it. This was the tipping point for me. All my so called classmates and friends I had suddenly turned on me and I was alone. Truly alone, left half dead for the vultures to pick at. I broke. I broke into so many little pieces, all those people I grew up around people I trusted turned. I couldn\\'t touch anyone with out them screaming \"DONT TOUCH ME GERM\" \"GREAT THANKS NOW I HAVE TO WASH MYSELF\" and other hurtful shit like that. They couldn\\'t even sit in a chair I had used without washing it and sanitizing it. Okay I say I was alone but I had 2 friends, payton and dane, they tried to help they tried everything they could but the other kids wouldn\\'t back down. Half way thru the school year I attempted suicide. I had the steak knife pointed at my heart and started pushing, I drew a little blood but it hurt to much so I stuck around. I had only told dane and he kept it quite for a while like I asked him to but one day he told me that he had to tell the teacher, it wasnt something he liked knowing and didnt like how close I was to not being here. So he told that I wasnt feeling good in my head, that I was going thru some tough times due to the class and what they were doing. This teacher had 0 clue that it was happening and immediately went to the principal. Brought me with her and told me to tell her what was going on. I played dumb for so long hoping that it would just end. I didnt want to deal with it but they persisted and eventually brought dane in and asked him what was up. After he started to say something I broke, I told them almost everything. About me wanting to die, not wanting to live and how I wished everyone else would die first. I didnt tell them how i had attempted suicide. My worst fears had come true, I spoke up and now everyone hated me. They couldn\\'t bully me but did they hate me. After the whole class got a ripped a new ass hole for pushing a kid to suicidal thoughts (yes I told them I had thoughts, no I didnt tell them I tried) I came back into the class room and I\\'m greeted with silence and stone cold eyes staring back at me. The first thing this kid told me (who I thought was one of the people that I had as an acquaintance) \"You know OP fuck you, you go and cry to the principal that we dont treat you nicely well guess what? You want us to treat you with dignity and respect well how about trying to treat us that way? Next time think before you speak\". I can\\'t tell you how much this affected me. That kid got sent home for the rest of the week. This is supposed to be where that part of the story ends right? No those fuckers came back the next and kept calling me the germ, kept bullying me and bullied me harder than before. Grade 7 was a repeat of grade 6. Aging more and more I hid more and more of my emotions and just kept feeding off others and relying on them for how to react in different situations. Elementary school behind me and moving to middle school I made new friends, a new chapter in life. Friendsthat didnt judge, one guy even had the same name as me \"mysteriouslyreddited\". I started to notice girls at this point too. Two girls in particular, quinn and Anna. Quinn is a couple years younger than I had been babysat by my mother and I by her mother, they switched out as they both worked. And she, well Quinn\\'s amazing, pretty no beautiful, shes got these eyes that just, her hair... wow. And her smile (._. ) just everything. She was my first crush although quickly forgotten (we went to different schools. You know out of sight out of mind. K not like that but I hadn\\'t seen her in a while). Anna on the other had, well I can describe her similarly, but things were different with anna. They were. Easier??? Its. Well she was the girl I fell head over heels for and she knew it. We talked for hours upon hours but it was never meant to be. I continued on the same way I did in elementary school, by wearing armor and growing my onion. Anna and I stayed close for a couple years me being wrapped around her finger while she went after other guys. I got her a couple boyfriends reluctantly, I Introduced her to a couple guys I knew she was crushing on and I enjoyed watching her be with them (as i look back i was feeding off of her boyfriends emotions and mixed them with my own. Bad idea 0/10 would recommend.) And well this went as well as you may guess, it went great. WRONG. I was confused and shut off, shut down and shot down. I don\\'t remember what started a fight between us but it went on for months. It became personal for the both of us. I told her not to come to my funeral she told me to fuck off and go die, words were said damage was done and I thought I was okay with it. I learned quickly that I in fact was not okay and my fight with her had broken my armour and I was bare, everything was out and we both fell into depression because of what we did to each other. I was having more and more suicidal thoughts. I had spiraled to my lowest point that I\\'ve ever been, self harm, alchohol, skipping school, it was the worst part of my life. Highschool is the hardest for everyone isnt it?? Its not oof my bad. I was skipping school, fighting with my mothers husband, smoking pot and drinking waaaaay to much booze. The fall out of not having anna in my life was ruining me, yes I felt for her and yes i wanted her back in my life but the hatred for her at the same time was almost outweighing the good I felt for her. I cut everyday for over 2 years. I didnt know what to do, the pain felt good and brought me out of my head and prevented me about thinking about anything as long as the blade was on me. My entire depressive episode was brought on because I couldn\\'t stand up for myself or tell myself it\\'s okay or when to stop. I lost myself, lost my armor, lost everything. Or at least I thought I lost everything when in reality I was only just discovering life. I became cold and truly shut off my emotions and didnt even feed off others. I became a robot. I woke up late went to school skipped all my classes, went home played COD or skyrim and went to bed. Rinse repeat and that\\'s how I lived from day to day, month to month, for a couple years. I still haven\\'t reconnected with anna (anna if you end up reading this im sorry for the bad memories. I like to think that we still have some love left for each other but i know that\\'s false). As I lived like this my family life started to become stretched and strained. Being brought up as a christian I was told to believe in god, that hes the answer to all and just ask him for help. I called bullshit and that if he truly cared that none of us would suffer, if we suffer then why the fuck did jesus die on the cross for us? My grandparents and mother didnt take kindly to these words and how dare I speak about god in that manor. After mass one sunday i would have been like 15 we were at the grandparents and the topic of vacations came up and how I hadn\\'t been on one in years and I\\'d like to go when peeps went down to visit cousins from another town a days drive away. It was spring break and they were leaving next weekend. I inquired if I could go with them and because of my grades I was told no. I told them if they let me go I\\'d pick up the pace in school and i would try, but only if they let me go. Well my attitude needed to be fixed because the next thing I know my mother is yelling at me and telling me how entitled I am and that Id be lucky to consider even going. Me being the teen I was I yelled back. Fuck yous were exchanged. My grandfather had enough and tried to manhandle me, no fucking chance gramps not in my current state. We had a fist fight that ended up with him having broken glasses, he litterally ripped my shirt off me, ripped my necklace off and threw me into a door and him thrown onto the floor. He got up and started to yell \"get the fuck out of here, you can come back when your damn well ready to apologize until then get out!!!!\". I replied with \"well then I guess it wasnt nice knowing you. When you\\'re ready to get your grandson back track me down and tell me how sorry you are\" and left without looking back. He did track me down the next day and told me he was sorry about how he reacted and stepping so far out of line. That night after we made up and got a blizzard I went home to find my mother\\'s husband fuming because of how I talked to my mother which cause a fight with him. That was the night I lost my home, my family, he had disowned me and cast me out like garbage. Even tho that was one of my lowest points I didnt see it as a loss. Yea i was fucked but i was also free to do what I want when I want. So I started working on myself. I moved to a new city enrolled in a new school and started fresh. While I did climb out of my depressing hole I have yet to beat depression. I got a great girlfriend and living large now adays . Started some anti depressants, counseling and what not. Well now Im gonna skip ahead to why I wanted to get some baggage off my back. A few weeks ago I went out to the bar with some friends and I ran into none other than quinn. I\\'d had some pregame drinks, had some drinks while I was there. I didnt eat anything that day, was already dehydrated and alcohol should not be consumed like that while on meds. So I was already drunk, feeling great, I\\'d seen quinn once and didnt know what to say so I just smiled and \"ignored\" her. Well let me tell you it was so fucking hard to ignore her. I mean if you were me you\\'d find it impossible to. So I did what any drunk man does, i had a shot and approached her, asked if I could buy her a drink and  From what I remember we hit it off. I had a blast but tbh I was not looking for anything in her I just remembe how I used to feel but more Importantly j remembered all the fun times we use to have growing up and all the memories with her over the years. I was.. no i am lonely and she seemed to just kinda be there. So we were talking, and I looked at her and time just seemed to stop. We talked but I don\\'t remember what it was about. At one point I asked if I could kiss her. My self conscience was screaming at me telling me this was not okay but the alchohol was in too deep. There is so much that I wish I could remember about that night but I cant. I dont know what happened what I said or did. This is the hardest I\\'ve had to fight this depression in a long time and this time I\\'m worried that I won\\'t be able to win. I don\\'t recognize who I am anymore. I dont like this person I\\'ve become. I love my GF but I feel like I\\'m going to drag her down and make her depressed like me. I feel like I\\'m not good enough for her and I\\'m hurting her by being with her. I cant stop thinking about quinn but I think I fucked up even trying to be friends with her. There was a small spark there but nothing major besides I dont want there to be a spark right now, I\\'ve talked to my GF and she knows I have feelings for another. It was hard to deal with at first but after we talked about it she knows that im struggling with my feelings and that I\\'m not looking for a way to leave her. I\\'ve been on the verge of relapsing and going back to self harm. Im not crossing that line because when I do there\\'s no turning back. Im tired of being depressed and I want out but he hardest part is figuring out who i am and if I can keep all my current bridges or if I have to go out and build new bridges. Im gonna keep trudging on and finding my way thru this fucked up place we call earth. Again im sorry this was so long and all over the place, if you read it thanks for listening, if you skip over this story thanks for not wasting your time (that came out wrong but ov well).

I have always felt like I should not have been born a boy let alone live past 3 weeks (another failed diagnosis, lucky me right?). \\nMy childhood consisted of doing stuff to get attention but really all I wanted was to be liked a very hard thing to do when you are basically physically retarded and cannot talk like everyone else and constantly being reminded how you are such a failer that you couldn\\'t even be born right. Since my conciousness first made its way into this world I have found myself thinking as a girl, along with thinking how much better litterally my life would have been if I managed to get it right. My dad was never in the picture so growing up without a father has been difficult on its own, but of course I was informed my dad had the chance to come to America when I was born because of my condition, but he declined to start a new family and I\\'m sure he had other reasons. My mom always worked all the time so it was pretty much me and my older brother for some time. An older brother that constantly made fun of me along with my mom for how I talked and how I acted. My brother constantly calling me gay, faggot, bitch, you name it he\\'s done it. I\\'m sure he was unaware of how I felt inside but it traumatized me so much I am afraid of being myself. My body is not shaped how normal guy\\'s are either so I have no idea how to take that problem. At school o was labeled the retarded kid no one liked.\\nOnce I turned 11 my mom met a man, let\\'s call him D. D was/is military and I later found out they got married quick (span of a few months) to finance my surgeries because I came from a background of poverty being single parent with 2 kids (later 3). I was always treated like a pet and always had the harshest and most frequent punishments. I was always forced to do everything for everybody else. My brother had to go do something like talk to a neighbor to get the bike fixed, I had to do it, stuff like that. To this day I get asked by family to buy their plane tickets or order them stuff cause they \"don\\'t know how\". I have always been used all my life. I am nothing but a tool. As I patiently waited for the surgeries that I was supposed to get (atleast just the one to fix my nose and make me look somewhat normal) when I was 12, then delayed to 16, then 18, and finally at 19. I received the first surgery and all they did was make my life a living hell. \\nMedical history - The doctor messed up my nose and now theres a glasses size gap on the bridge of my nose, for the tip of it they put cartalage from my side [which they lied to me and took it out of under my right chest] is fat which I didn\\'t even care about having in the first place I just wanted my nose to be straight and deal with the rest later. I was put in a maxillary distractor (fancy name for cage on my head). To move my upper jaw forward so that they can reconstruct the palate (roof of my mouth) and straighten jaw or whatever they were doing I have no clue and it seemed unnessesary to me. It did however improve my speech just a tiny bit. I had to wear this crap o. My head for 4 months. Later I then made my own appointments 2 years later (22) and got a surgery for bonegraft. I am still missing the tooth implant which I cannot afford nor will I ever be able to, and I have to have another surgery on my nose again. I have always suffered from depression because of this but not only because of my unfortunate medical circumstances. (Also I have been getting pains around my abdominal area so either I\\'ve got something going on down there that shouldn\\'t be or when I was born the doctors decided it be best to stick a penis on me and call me a boy).\\nAs for the other reasons why I\\'m highly depressed and on the verge of collapsing. I was forced by my stepdad to go into debt. I wanted to go to college but I wanted to do it like everyone else, a real place surrounded by real people so I can maybe make atleast one friend and not be a total failer. Of course my luck hits home again and he forced me to go to an online college with the promiss of letting me use the money the army provides to him for school use. I agree and then he turns and days \"yea no... Do it yourself\". Landing me 16k debt that I can\\'t pay, 3k I was forced to pay (just to get my diploma) and 3k my mom was forced to pay for me to be able to enroll in classes. Before this though I was planning to join the military to get a one up on life, but apparently not God\\'s plan. Since when I brought up the idea he straight refused. I was not allowed to work or go out, I did not have an allowance or any type of money except money I got for my birthday ($20 every year, ages 18-19-20) and it didn\\'t help that I had no friends up until senior year in highschool (that summer is the only happy memories I have after leaving my home town. He was very controlling that\\'s why I feel I can\\'t do anything without the constant reminder of all the trauma I\\'ve faced.\\nI did however keep the promis I made to myself about joining the military. Unfortunately though I was not let in. After two years of waiting and providing all of the medical paperwork I was finally sent to MEPS for the Marines, finally a chance for me to straighten out my life and man up and get all these rediculous thoughts and feelings out my head. NOPE! Once I get there I take the ASVAP and score on the higher side (I know right smarts actually came in handy I might look like a retard but my mental capacity is on the higher side) scored 80. Go through medical everything good up until the physical, the doctor asks me if I always been tall and skinny (I have a very feminine body besides the lack of breasts and having a penis) I say yes, normal ok cool then I go to the eye exam and they tell me I have astigmatism in my left eye (this I knew it happened when I was about 5 or so, started hallucinating and seeing giant spiders with extream detail) I went to see if I can get this fixed they said and I quote \"the damage to your eye is so savire that we do not have the equipment required to even make a dent of progress, the best solution I can offer is to use the effected eye and hope it gets better over time, sorry but there is nothing we can do for you at this time.\" - Lasik doctor. So dream job at Marines = no go. The MEPS people tell me to try the army cause they accept pretty much anyone. I do and same thing they say I can\\'t join because of my stupid eye, gee thanks God. \\nAt this point I start thinking maybe it\\'s not meant to be and give up. \\nMy job history is halarious, atleast to me. Almost even didn\\'t get hired. First job at age 20, McDonald\\'s. Mom gets a house with my brother who got to live my fantasy of being in the military and travel the world, who then decides to mock me and make my life even worse by deciding he needs a surgery on his penis (he thought it was so curved he can\\'t have sex yet he never tried, now he\\'s depressed and thinks he can never have it and the doctor messed up, doctor also gave him circomsition) this happened during my attempt at joining the Marines. Throughout the course of 6 months he would constantly scream at the top of his lungs and say how God hates him, this is punishment, lash out at me for no reason, and make me feel not only unsafe but want to take my own life even more just to get out of that situation. Once we move into the new house this continues along with me every day for months on end calming him down explaining and telling him to be patient cause it\\'s not gunna heal right away and healing of the body depends on the mind state anyways. Because of the move I am forced to quit my job that I actually enjoyed, to transfer to another McDonald\\'s on the side of town we moved to (two towns down) I work there for 6 months before quitting because of how unfairly I was being treated, everything was my fault, I never did anything right, I was lazy, the works (even though I did mainly everybody\\'s job in the kitchen, everyday I washed the grill swept mopped multiple times a day, I would be on grill then on the table making the burgers, I\\'d go and get the 50 pound boxes from the freezer. You name it I did it.) I eventually quit after 6 months bought a one way ticket to California and said my goodbyes to my brother who called my mom crying saying I left and he tried to stop me... I was sick of his shit. I had shit I was dealing with all my life and now I have to deal with you and your problem too, (excuse the langauge but) fuck outta here with that shit. \\nI have so little control over my own life that I only spent 2 days in California before my mom told the entire family where I was and got my aunt (grandma\\'s sister so technically grandma, who\\'s also a nun) to somehow convince me to go to New York and stay with my uncle. I can\\'t believe I actually fell for their stupid guilt trip but somehow after only 5 days I was off to NYC. I told myself it\\'s probably best since there are lots of opportunities for me to be a musican. Wrong. I was basically plummited into the same exact situation with different people. Greedy money hungry aunt, no jobs, no money, an uncle who works at night sleeps durring the day, wierd daughter that turned into her mother. I had to get outta there it got to the point where she was looking through my stuff while I wasn\\'t there to find proof I could pay her $700 to stay in the shitty, stinky room they kept rabbits in. With a door that locks from the outside and a broken window, very small room at that. After two months of looking for jobs while making music simaltaniously I am being called a liar I good for nothing a lazy bum you name it that\\'s what she labeled me. I manage to get a job at McDonald\\'s again but in NY. I manage to set up the bonegraft appointment and lay on an air mattress for two weeks feeling useless and being called useless. I go back to work and then move into my grandpa\\'s room he was renting. Lucky for me he was on vacation for the next two months. Durring this time when my granpa came back j felt obligated and wanted to help with his bills ultimately giving him what little I had. 4 months pass and after much consideration and mom/brother begging for me to come back I oblige. \\nI then get a job at another McDonald\\'s in the next town over oppisate direction with the help of my old boss. I work there for 6 months before quitting because of the same drama the first time and hearing people continuously talking shit about me making me feel terrible about myself even more and with the emense parinoia I was experiencing due to smoking too much (the parinoia was about how I hid the fact I\\'m not normal and that I wish to be a girl and intricate details of my life).\\nIf you think that\\'s it well your wrong... My aunt comes to the USA on a visa and is put in a shit situation feeling unsafe, according to her. My mom is the only one in the USA she knows, mom folds and buys her a plane ticket to stay here for the time being, money my mom didn\\'t have, which is fine desperate times desperate measures and such. She stays here for an entire month and quickly realises there is nothing here, everything is far and you have to drive everywhere. The time that she was here I could have used to work on my music the 3 hours I was left alone in the house, but no. \\nEverything that she bought or well made me buy she complains and says it\\'s for someone else, complains she didn\\'t buy anything for herself and how she had to use my mom\\'s clothes cause instead of buy things for herself she bought for everyone else supposedly. She then says how she needs a phone and makes me go find one for her. After I go through the trouble of finding and iPhone 7 plus for a crazy deal ($150) which they usually go for 300-350 I go and I borrow money to go get her the phone. She then says oh... I wanted a more modern one....like yours.... I\\'m like ugh ok I reset mine give her it and she then says she will give me the 150 (my phone was iPhone X pristine condition). Months pass I still don\\'t have a job (stopped looking to focus on getting my licence), everybody keeps making excuses not to teach me, and the piece of crap car that my brother was going to pass down to me needs a new battery so I can\\'t use it, and he also decided to retract the offer before I got the chance to use it and is selling it because he doesn\\'t want to pay for it.

Maybe I'll get some advice, maybe someone will read it and realize they are not alone.\\nI’ve started writing this so many times and lost motivation half way through. This is yet another attempt, let’s see what happens.\\nI’m a 30 year old woman, I work as a photographer for a fashion company with a degree in Graphic Design, volunteer at a cat rescue 2 days a week, and suffer from depression and social/general anxiety disorder.\\nI first realized my teen angst wasn’t just a “phase” sometime in my early 20’s. As a teenager I would do the normal things: drink, do drugs, smoke weed. I would also write a lot but this writing, in hindsight, was some of the deepest cries for help. I’ve since lost that precious notebook, but I did come upon snippets of that “poetry” in my other sketchbooks. The stuff wasn’t anything out of the ordinary - I grew up listening to emo and other such heart wrenching music - and the style was really just lyrics trying to artistically describe the dark cloud that was inside of me every minute of every day. I lost interest in that activity around the age of 20.\\nI was always a shy person. I played with friends during school, but I was never allowed to have anyone over or go to anyone’s house. As a result, I was always found by myself in the yard skipping rope alone. My parents brought me to Canada when I was 9 years old in order to expand my options for education. I was born in Russia where there wasn’t much choice at the time to do anything with your life other than engineering, medicine or teaching. In that aspect, I thank them. I was able to attend an art school in Toronto and attain my Graphic Design degree which my anxious artistic brain appreciates.\\nWhen I arrived in Canada I didn’t speak much English and was in an ESL program. In that first year, 4th grade, I was bullied for not speaking the language. Some girls quickly realized that it would be fun to put rocks (the little pebbles from the playground) down my pants while we had “carpet time” (when all the kids gather around crossed legged on the floor in front of the teacher during a lesson.) They knew I wouldn’t say anything, partly because I couldn’t physically, partly because I couldn’t mentally. Kids would kick my chair constantly as they walked by, someone even throw things at me from the back. I brushed it off, went on with it. I did have two great friends (one of which is still in my life albeit we aren’t close.)\\nThis childish bullying subsided after the first year. I went off to another school in grade 5 after moving buildings with my parents. 6th grade was split. It was yet another school (moving from elementary to middle school) and then half way through 6th grade, after establishing quite a solid group of new friends, I was transferred to a new school after yet another move by my parents. I had to start over with the friend thing and luckily I befriended a girl right away. She was also an outcast, being extremely tiny and skinny for her age and also didn’t fit in with the “cool popular kids.” Here I was laughed and looked down upon for being new, having 1 friend, and being so extremely shy. After a while I became close with another girl, let’s call her Jessica. 7th grade went by bearably with her around, outside minor incidents like having the basketball thrown at my head during recess. I was also developing extremely bad acne, so I was doomed to be the ugly shy girl for the next few years.\\nEnding of 8th grade is where the real trouble started with Jessica. She had an “in” with the cooler kids in the grade and being so attached to her, I got to hang out with the group occasionally. This is where we started “relationships” with two boys. She was with lets call him Andrew and I was with let’s call him Mike. We would hang out after school a lot and one day I brought them all over to my house. Mike took me down to my parent’s cellar at one point and where I thought I would have my first kiss, my hands were forced down onto his penis. I didn’t know how to retaliate so I went with it. Instead of a first kiss, I gave my first hand job. The next time we hung out was at the movies. I was brought to the bathroom for what I thought was a make out session but turned out to be an attempt at a blow job. I can’t remember whether I went through with it, I just remember crying that evening. I soon found out that Andrew and Mike had a bet going of who would get their dick sucked first and Jessica agreed to bring me into the group so they could use me for that bet. These things bled into high school. The rumours started that I was a slut and were reinforced with photos being distributed throughout the school. The photos were of me wearing see through mesh pants in provocative poses that Jessica took of me in her room one night when we were having a fun “fashion” night. She wore them too, although somehow the photos of her never got distributed. \\nFinally a new girl came to the school lets call her Beth and finally things seemed to calm down. We had a great friendship going and were inseparable during high school (to the point where people were calling us lesbians.) I even attended her wedding two years ago, she’s a beautiful human being. I tried my best to have a normal life. I threw myself into art. I would come to school at 7 in the morning so spend time in the photography dark room lab. I got great marks in my classes and my teachers loved me. Of course throughout this time I did the regular teenage girl stuff. I liked boys, I would make out with them. I was already well trained in the hand job department so guys learned to hand me over to their friends once they were done with me. I just did it. It made them happy. And in my mind, that made me good at it. Why not do the thing that I felt I excelled at? Of course none of that behaviour helped the growing rumours. \\nI first tried drugs in 10th grade. Beth and I would skip school, pop ecstasy, spend the day together. This went on for about a year in the 11th grade where my marks drastically plummeted. I’m not sure what the triggering factor for me to stop was, but I managed to graduate high school on the honour roll. At the end of 12th grade I met lets call him Sam. We dated for 2 years, I lost my virginity to him, but I will always remember doubting his intentions. Did he stay with me for the sex? Did he only want me around because I would smoke weed with him? It didn’t matter. I lost romantic interest in him after a year but stayed together despite us fighting because it was comfortable and a habit I just didn’t want to, or couldn’t break.\\nI got into my top school of choice and spent the first year working hard. After my break up with Sam, I met lets call him Dale. It was interesting at first. He would show up at my work almost daily and chat and finally we started going on real dates. He brought me gifts and showered with me with attention. I now realize that it was borderline stalker behaviour. He wouldn’t take no for an answer even if I didn’t really feel like doing anything. The thing with Dale is kind of an on and off ordeal. We were never fully together but would hang out often usually drinking or going on drives. I was starting to get really put off by him, but one night he insisted on hanging out. As you well know by now, I have trouble saying no. So we went to the bar, got a buzz going and then went driving. (I know how shameful it is to drink and I drive. I know first hand because I almost killed my friend during a drunk driving episode. I haven’t done it since and will never do it again.) We were in the car and I was completely insistent that this was a non sexual meet up. But he wouldn’t stop trying to kiss me, to push my hands on to his crotch, then pushing my head down, asking me to just suck it a little. I did it just to make him shut up so I could go home. I haven’t seem him since them. I refused to talk to him and eventually had to block him. To this day he tries to make attempts at communication but nothing dangerous. \\nThe truly destructive behaviour started around 22 when I began to frequent parties. At first it was drinking, and a lot of it. Then I met a 28 year old man lets call him Izack. He was a DJ and very much into the rave party scene. It was with him when I tried coke for the first time at the age of 23 or 24. Lets just call the rest a blur. I would party twice a week, heavily on drugs, go to school completely hung over. Long story short, I just managed to graduate, scraping by with a warning letter and passing marks given to me probably only out of the kindness of my professor’s heart. I loved Izack. He was older, had more experience, best sex I’ve ever had and he made me forget everything and everyone. He lived downtown in an apartment with two other roommates who also loved to party and we all got along quite well. The sanctuary of that apartment was heavenly. I would be able to spend all my time there away from my strict Russian parents. Then Izack started going on the road a lot more due to his DJ career flourishing. When he was away, I would come to his place and clean everything. I bought him a huge new TV for his room. I wanted him to come home to a beautiful place. In my mind that was me saying thank you for letting me stay with him rent free for so many days of the week. \\nAbout a year into our relationship, I went for a gynaecologist check up which was followed by a phone call saying that I have an STD. They told me to get myself and my partner into the office so we could be given medication. It was nothing overly serious, cleared up with a few pills but I had to have a serious conversation with Izack. He swore on his life that he never cheated on me. He begged me to believe him which after hours upon hours of me crying and pleading, I finally did. But I never got over the nagging feeling that something wasn’t right. So after a month of uncertainty, over the phone on my birthday (I remember that day so clearly), I asked him one more time. I’m not sure what made him tell me truth this time around, but yes, of course he slept with someone on tour and yes that is how I contracted the STD.\\nI was a complete and utter wreck for the next few months. The drugs and alcohol increased. I went on Tinder and began my first sex binge. At one point I managed to sleep with 6 different men in one week. All I wanted to do was to forget the hurt and I didn’t know how. Again, all of this is very blurry so I can’t say the exact moment that Izack came back into my life but he did. I remember going to a bar to meet him to get closure, to finally say I forgive him and that I’m moving on. That meeting ended up with me in his apartment and sex. We then got “back together”, continued the destructive behaviour until his next tour where he slept with someone again. I let that one go easily since we never stated that we were officially a couple again. I think this is where I learned how to numb my brain from hurt. I wasn’t mad at him anymore, I just quietly walked away and threw myself into my second huge sex binge on Tinder. After a few months of this, I met a guy lets call him Jon. \\nWe dated for something close to a year. This relationship was also fuelled by alcohol, drugs and parties. But at this point I didn’t want another life. The relationship involved me crying almost every day at work with something abusive he may have said to me that day. For example, he loved to make me feel like an idiot for asking him why it took him hours to answer a text massage. I was told I was crazy on an almost daily basis. I will fast forward to the end, where a girl (who is now a friend) reached out to me saying that she was also dating Jon, for 6 months now. She spotted us at a party kissing, and lost her mind. Apparently she had no knowledge of me for the long while they were together. It turns out, that we weren’t the only ones. I came to the knowledge that he had slept with 8 different people during the span of being with me. This included his upstairs neighbour who I was constantly told not to worry about. \\nI laughed at this. I didn’t cry, I didn’t feel angry, I laughed, pulled out my phone and on to the next Tinder binge I went.\\nIt took me about 6 months to get into my next relationship. This one was with a kind man who would never do a thing to hurt me. It lasted for about 2 years. I met his parents and he met mine. We were talking about marriage and moving in together but it ended up falling apart during our search for an apartment. We just weren’t right for each other.\\nSo this is where I am now. 30 years old, living back with my parents. I have since stopped the partying because that life doesn’t satisfy me anymore and my body can’t handle it. I have been coke free for about a year now mainly because I can’t afford it. But I drink. I drink several times a week because I can’t stand my job. I drink because I feel trapped in my own mind. I drink because of my living situation. I drink because nothing I do excites me. I drink about 3 times a week and once I crack a bottle of wine, there is no way I can stop. That bottle is getting drunk to the last drop and more often than not, a second one gets opened and lasts about half way until I pass out. \\nThe job thing - realized I’m the only one who can help myself there so I have been taking lots of photos and editing them in an effort to update my portfolio but sitting down and editing those photos sober just isn’t an option. I go to work, I laugh with my coworkers, but at the end of the day, the only thing that makes me happy and that I took forward to is that next drink. I started exercising and have been continuing to do so pretty consistently but I always fall off the boat because I can’t stay excited and motivated. \\nLast night I came home to my collection of wine bottles all out and displayed in front of me by my dad. My mom discovered the first bottle in my closet when she couldn’t find my cat, or so she says. She then proceeded to go through every crevice of my room and pulled out the 20 or so I had hidden. Long story short, my life of drinking after work and during my own photo editing hours is over and I am terrified. I feel like I have nothing happy to come home to. I spent all last night crying and today is the first day I didn’t show up to work because of this. The thing is - I don’t know if I want to stop. I’ve had thoughts of suicide since my early teenage years and they have never gone away. I’ve cut myself on numerous occasions. I have dabbled with the idea of overdosing on my anxiety and depression medication. I did go into therapy for a few months but that turned out way too pricey for my minimal salary. My dad has offered to pay for my therapy last night, but this is an offer I’m not sure I want to take. I just want it to be over. The only times things are okay in my brain is when I am sleeping, or when I am heavily buzzed. I don’t have children, nor a boyfriend and I have maybe 2 friends, so I’m finding it difficult to see a purpose to go on. \\nI would like to finish by saying how awful I feel about putting this out there. The amount of times the word “I” is used is upsetting and selfish since I know there are people out there who have it way worse than me. Like my parents have pointed out numerous times, I have nothing to be sad about. I have a good job, a warm house, food and water. I have a car that my dad so kindly gave to me when he bought himself a new one. And they are right. I have it so good. But inside, that dark cloud just won’t lift and there is no way I can describe it in words to someone who hasn’t felt the pull of it.\\nThank you, from the bottom of my heart to anyone who read this fully, attempted to read it, or even glanced at it.

My problem is that I basically just sit in my apartment all day watching T.V. or playing games. I\\'ve met a handful of people either in the halls, or knocking on doors when I first moved in (just to introduce myself and \"say hi\" - which took a LOT of courage for me as I\\'ve got social anxiety and fear the heck out of getting out of my comfort zone.\\nAt any rate, so far I\\'ve met (or at least casually said \"hi\" and at times attempted to start a conversation with to a \"handful\" of people either in the dining hall they have set up for the lunch program I\\'m signed up for or in the hallways. But I frankly can\\'t find pretty much anyone I want to or am capable of even really having a conversation with letting alone really getting to know them. There was one guy that I liked, but he was like in a bad mood that day or is just really introverted (and that\\'s coming from an \"uber-introvert\" LOL) or something like that - he didn\\'t even want to offer up his name.\\nHaving said that, here\\'s my real problem (and likely the point where you all start to \"hate\" me lol/smh):\\n1. I\\'m admittedly somewhat \"bigoted\" if you will against PwD (\"persons w/ disabilities\" for those unfamiliar with the acronym). A \"self-hating PwD\", if you will. It\\'s NOT that I find anything inherently \"wrong\" or \"bad\" with PwD, so much as it is I\\'m so fucking god-damned sick and tired of being labeled as nothing BUT a PwD, and having us always being pigeonholed into having to spend time with one another, because \"normal\" (for lack of a better, more \"P.C.\" term) society doesn\\'t want anything to do with us and \"God forbid\" they actually want to make friends with us or spend time with us.\\n2. I will say, there are a number of people here that are either intellectually (***significantly***) \"below my level\" OR they have some sort of speech impediment (probably from some sort of issue with their brain that interferes with their brain\\'s ability to produce speech or something like that sorry, I\\'m not an expert on those disabilities nor speaking apparently as this is a major run on sentence....sorry) - neither of which there is anything intrinsically wrong with whatsoever, but it DOES severely impact my ability to want to be friends with them or get to know them. I quite simply no longer have the patience anymore to try to get to know somebody who doesn\\'t have the mental capacity to talk about anything more than her apparent obsession with \"kitties\" (true story, there is actually someone here who all she talks about is cats) or to try to discern what someone is saying every time they open their mouths because unfortunately they are so impaired mentally that they struggle to form coherent speech. That\\'s like ***WELL*** over 50% of the people I\\'ve come across so far. And the ones who aren\\'t impaired in those ways that I\\'ve met so far, are either significantly older than me (this apartment\\'s average age I\\'d say is well over 50+ and I\\'m not yet 34) or we just have nothing in common as I\\'m obsessed with sports and movies and T.V. and I have yet to meet a single person here who has the same interests. (NOTE: Sorry I should\\'ve tried to found a way to break this up into more paragraphs, but couldn\\'t figure out a good way to do so).\\nNow, mind you - I know damn well that my inherent biases and SUPER anti-social tendencies are playing a (big?) part here, but I just can\\'t bring myself to find anybody here who I want to get to know or hang out with. For that matter, none of the people I ***have*** introduced myself to so far have bothered to call me or knock on my door or even say \"hi\" in passing me in the hallways.\\nI\\'ve thought about trying to find a way to \"get involved\" in the community *outside* of the building, but between my \"anti-social\" tendencies and fear running my life and scaring the shit out of me in that sense every way possible prohibiting me from doing it so far, the other problem I have with it, is there is basically only about a 3-hour window - maximum - that I want to fill during the **daytime** hours (roughly 12-ish to 4:45-ish, my shows start at 5:00).....including transportation, which having to rely on \"para-transit\", means I could spend most of that time waiting).\\nAnd even that time I could probably spend catching up with shows I\\'ve missed that I want to see on demand. Basically, as has been the case for as long as I can remember, I\\'m a T.V. (and computer) ADDICT - and I\\'m largely okay with it, except I know it\\'s unhealthy and antisocial. Ideally, I\\'d LIKE to be more social, but between being addicted to my electronics and being scared to death of socializing and the prospect of socializing with a bunch of people in the building that quite frankly I don\\'t seem to *want* to get to know (and they\\'ve certainly made no attempt to get to know me with the exception of one old lady who we don\\'t have much in common, and she\\'s already admitted that I\\'m a \"dick\" - which I already knew so I wasn\\'t offended, the idea is less than appetizing. (NOTE: thankfully, she doesn\\'t seem to mind that I\\'m a dick, but again we only ate lunch together one time and I never got her apartment number and I haven\\'t seen her since).\\nSo to make a long story short - how do I get over my fears, and out of my funk, while still maintaining the things I enjoy (like surfing the net and binge-ing on T.V.) ?

This is my story of my battle with depression. It’s long, but it would mean the world to me if someone could read it. : I’m just a 20 year old girl, with an amazing family. I have 2 parents who have given me the world, and I am the oldest sibling of 4. I have had a great education all of my life, I went to an awesome university in my town but I had to take a gap year due to my mental health issues. I live on the East Coast, and I have all of the opportunities in the world to live the life I dream of living. I have a therapist, a beautiful house, an absolutely amazing boyfriend, and some close friends. Nowadays though, the life I dream of living consists of these few things: Energy, excitement about my days, and a positive outlook. At this rate, switching my major, finishing college, and moving along in life feels impossible. \\nI took a gap year because the lifelong anxiety I had was starting to take a toll. Originally I had just planned to take a semester off because I wanted to go to therapy and then get back to school. I didn’t want to be out for too long because I thought I wouldn’t want to go back. But that was in September. It’s now March, and after having mono for a few months, not being in school, struggling with anxiety, feeling lonely partially because I am not in school and I’m watching all of my peers live the life I had planned for myself, coupled with mental illness, I have developed depression. At first my psychologist didn’t think I was depressed, because the symptoms of mono coincide with depression. Also, some people have a depressive episode when their anxiety is very bad, which mine was. Luckily it’s a bit better now. But the depression has taken the front row seat now, so that rains on my parade pretty badly. I also talked about the fear of becoming depressed a lot, too. But now fast forward, I most certainly have depression. We are aware of this now. \\nWhat I don’t understand about depression, and never did until I was diagnosed, is the feeling of being hopeless and having nothing to live for, like many depressed people talk about. I used to think, “how could you feel hopeless? There are so many beautiful things in this world. There are so many beautiful places, faces, moments, things to look back on and things to look forward to. You have so many talents and so many amazing qualities, and you make people so happy without even realizing it”. But now, I understand. \\nI truly understood the hopeless feeling when I started realizing the amounts of mental and physical energy it took for me to perform mental tasks... to even *want* to do them, and have a reason for them. My body feels like a rock that I am lugging around. I feel like I don’t even have the capacity to think like I used to, yet somehow I still have all of the energy to overthink. But my creativity is stifled, I don’t see the world as colorfully as I used to, and it feels like even on the nicest of days the world is still the gray winter we’ve had here for so long. I just **don’t have the energy** for almost anything. And sometimes I will get myself going, but I don’t feel as if I am doing my tasks or feeling things the way I used to. I don’t feel full of life and wonder anymore. Small moments don’t bring me a boatload of joy. I used to pride myself in finding happiness and joy in the little things, but now my surroundings feel dull and it’s always like I’m searching for something bigger. Which I know isn’t the issue here. It’s just my brain. I drove to Philly with a friend about 3 weeks ago on a Saturday just for fun, and I thought the new environment would make all the difference, but it just didn’t. I was definitely filled with more enthusiasm than I usually was, but I could only keep that energy for so long. And once again, I didn’t feel how I used to feel before all of this hit. So, back to my original point. I feel hopeless. Because how am I supposed to get anywhere with this lack of motivation and energy? \\nI simply just don’t have the energy or stamina to maintain the activities I need and want to do. I know what’s good for me, what *should* be good for me and making me happy. After all, it used to. But I am always tired in some way. I never feel well rested. I used to be active and energetic but now my body is telling me to lay down, even if it’s bad for my brain. I tell myself I should take care of myself the way a parent would take care of a child. That my body is worth taking care of. But **I am just so sick of FORCING myself to do things. And then not being able to create habits because of the amount of energy it takes. And then feeling totally hopeless.** \\nI do not want to “accept” that I’m depressed. I don’t even like saying I’m depressed, and I hate it even more when people say it isn’t curable. How isn’t it curable? I didn’t have it my whole life. Maybe the signs were there subtly, but if I knew about them, I could’ve done something before I hit this barrier. \\nMy family has done everything for me and I love them so much. I really do. I absolutely love my parents. My mom is so creative, free spirited, stubborn, funny, and on the go. My dad is wise, determined, nurturing, hilarious, and level headed. My siblings all have minds of their own, too. My sister is adventurous and creative like me. My brothers are, well, my brothers. Haha. My grandma is an absolute saint. But a lot of the time, especially recently, it’s hard not to distance myself from my parents when I feel so down. I just feel like the disappointment who is always being watched because of my vulnerable mental state. Everything is always about what I’m not doing, and I know it’s because they care and think me doing things will help, but it’s just not that simple. I get irritable, and this causes tension. I kind of isolate myself from them. Not really, but I just don’t initiate conversation with them. I feel awkward. I’ll fix this but it’s just hard. \\nSomehow — I hate admitting this because I never wanted to get to a place where I felt my significant other was one of the biggest sources of my happiness because it’s unhealthy — my boyfriend makes me feel more alive than most things anymore. It won’t be this way forever, but right now it is. Maybe God, or the universe, or whoever, placed him in my life for a reason. He is the most positive, energetic, happy, stress free, level headed, patient, caring, affectionate, hilarious, awesome person I know. This kid reassured me everyday, just because he **feels** like it, of how much he loves me, how I make him the happiest kid in the world, how I brighten his days, how I make him laugh like nobody else, and any other sweet thing you can think of. And to me, they aren’t cliches because I know he means them. He reassured me that he knows who I am outside of this depression. He loves me for me. And he constantly reminds me that he is here with me every step of the way, that he believes in me, and that he will not leave my side. It blows my mind. I don’t understand it, but man is it relieving. I cannot even explain how much I love him. He just **never** gets frustrated with me, and always prioritizes my happiness. He lives an insanely well balanced life, good for him. He has perfect mental health, and I envy it but I’m more so just grateful to have someone like that in my life. Honestly, he’s been a saving grace some days. \\nI want to get back in school as soon as possible. I want to know how to build myself back up so that I can have a daily routine, and energy, and be excited. I don’t want to feel like my brain and body are stifled anymore. I want myself back. I struggle so much with feelings of “is this worth it?” Because is it? People would surely miss me, but what about *me*? How am I supposed to live if I feel like everything is a matter of me dragging myself out of a ditch? \\nI wish that I could go back in time, and almost just watch my young self from afar. I was so happy go lucky. Spunky. Happy. I wish I could just hold my own hand, and see my smile and take it with me into the future. \\nSometimes I get really scared because I have thoughts about dying. I don’t want to die and I don’t want to commit suicide but what if I become that way to escape the pain? And I go nuts? And I lose my boyfriend and those who matter to me? \\nI wouldn’t wish depression upon anyone. If you read to here then thank you. And if you have any advice, I’m dying to hear it.

Probably with myself?  \\nI\\'m a 22 years old male from Switzerland. Right now it is 3 am here.   \\nWhen I was 11/12 I became very heavily depressed and apathic due to a traumatic childhood, but also further traumas throughout my life made it worse. Therapists didn\\'t notice it and prevention of any further psychological damage was quite late.   \\nI lived a toxic childhood, youth and young adulthood and noticed me being \"different\" when I burned out and everything I bottled up for 18 years just bursted out of me, so I lost my sanity for quite a while and was put down in a mental hospital  \\nAt this point my personality already manifested in a very self destructive way and it was diagnosed as a \"combined personality disorder\". Mental hospitals made my symptoms worse and therapists struggled helping me to an extend where I\\'ve been told \"I can\\'t help you.\".\\nI just recently came out of a very toxic and devastating relationship. Where I finally managed to open up to my partner, who was 4 years older than me. Just to be lied and cheated on, which was, according to her, my fault. I used to get very aggressive in response and use that aggression to become a better version of myself, work out more disciplined, study harder, work better.  \\nBut at this point I\\'m just exhausted. So much that I just stopped caring about anything. Mental pain wasn\\'t easy, but I knew I was alive nonetheless, I always had some shimmer of hope no matter how bad my life was, no matter how many people I\\'ve lost and been betrayed by.  \\nBut now I\\'m here, in the middle of the night not knowing how I feel, I don\\'t know if I feel good, if I feel bad or sad. The voices in my head are gone but at the same time so very empty.  \\nI feel empty, nothing more, nothing less. Pure darkness so deep you feel like you could fall down and never land on ground again.\\nI struggle sleeping, because my mind wants to repeat the past and revisit negative feelings/traumas over and over again. I don\\'t just struggle trusting, I\\'m even paranoid at this point. If a person is nice to me, I immediately expect this person to hurt me at some point. I don\\'t wanna feel alone anymore, I don\\'t wanna **be** alone no more. This is all I\\'ve wanted and expected from my partners.\\nI\\'ve met this girl recently. Very friendly, nice, beautiful and she understands me quite well.  \\nBut I see her as a threat, to me, my soul, my shattered heart. Something that could losen my sanity even more. As if she\\'s the next to add more oil to the fire until it becomes an inferno, another crack into the wall until it breaks and falls apart.   \\nI\\'ve never had anyone in my life who was truely by my side. Only people pretending to be.  \\nBut now she\\'s here, offering me help, and I\\'m here, struggling to take it. This isn\\'t about her, more about something I noticed. I\\'ve never been offered an ear like this, it feels like somebody really means it this time because she\\'s been through similar problems and traumas in life. Usually I\\'d not have to react because I knew it was just a friendly gesture and not really meant to help. More of a noble act to add something more to their superior ego.\\nToday everything I bottled up the past few days, weeks, months and during my most recent relationship rocked down on my chest and the sadness struck upon me. I felt like I\\'d go insane and would need somebody by my side, somebody understanding me from deep down their heart and giving me the feeling of not being alone.   \\nI thought about the offer she made. I said to myself: \"This would be just what I\\'d need right now\", and was about to accept the offer, tell her that I\\'d need her right now, that she should come by. But at this point it felt like my hand could not reach her, as if something is stopping me, blocking me, pulling me away.   \\nThe more I wanted to do it, the more I tried to overcome it, the more it got painful, I felt like bones and muscles were breaking and twisting the closer I got to it. An incredible pain of my negative and darker sides, like dark hands pulling me away and whispering \"This isn\\'t what you want, what we want\".  \\nAnd I didn\\'t. I\\'ve let go of it. Pulled my hand away. And sat down, together with all my negativity just like a meet up, surrounded by my past and all the horrible pain I\\'ve been through before. Staring at my wall in pure emptiness.\\nThinking about it, I noticed asking for it made me feel selfish, egoistic. Things I\\'ve been told in my past repeatedly by people I looked up to, until it got manifested in my mind, that asking for help is something for the weak, that it is egoistic to impose your very own burden on somebody else, to drag and pull down somebody else into your darkness, just because of their bright and shiny light. The reason why I hesitated, struggled and finally gave up on it.\\nSo I\\'m sitting here, wondering \"Is it okay to ask somebody else for help?\".  \\nOfcourse people say it is okay to accept help from a person you love or who is close to you.   \\nBut I also know that people like me, depressed and mentally ill ones, can be hard to handle. We can be complicated and contradictory because of our defense mechanisms. And I\\'m wondering how much of a pain and burden I could be to someone as soon as I accept the offer of help.   \\nAs if the person is about to get into an oath with me, a bond that letting go of has the condition of me getting hurt and disappointed again. Which I think I can not bear another time, because I\\'m exhausted.   \\nAt the same time, all I\\'d need, want and appreciate, is what I always lacked, pure warmth of a person, that I feel is coming out of the heart, that calms me during this chaotic storm called \"Life\".\\nThere\\'s this one particular thought that is bugging me, every single day, the past few years.  \\nSomething I always ask myself when I found myself deep down in my dark hole, isolated and distanced from every human being.

I\\'ve been going to school very slowly and gradually built up to being able to handle a real work load. \\nThis past fall I was accepted into a program. The program completion is about 2 years away. On the first day of the program, I met this girl. She was stunning. I\\'m not going to give a ton of identifying detail in this post, but needless to say that I was immediately attracted to her. Of course, I thought about asking her out, but, being the depressed person that I am, I immediately thought that she\\'s out of my league. I also thought about the fact that if it doesn\\'t go well, we will be stuck in the same classes, day in and day out, for the next 2 years. I guess I was afraid that it would be unprofessional or awkward.\\nTwo weeks go by before we see each other again and classes actually start. On the first day of class, she sat next to me and almost immediately teases me. Now I\\'m like, \"great. She\\'s beautiful and witty. This sucks.\" Over the next few days I come to find out that she is *very* intelligent, as well. She\\'s kind; she\\'s fit; she\\'s an athlete; she has a smile that makes me weak. It\\'s honestly hard to look directly at her. This is a bit of a ramble. The point is that I developed a huge crush on her. And it hasn\\'t gone away. I thought perhaps that it\\'d be an infatuation that would fade over time, but instead I find myself thinking about her constantly.\\nI\\'m typically an indecisive, hesitant person, in general. The idea of asking this girl out, though, was just too enormous. *What if she rejects me? What if we go out on one or two dates and then she rejects me? What if we actually date for a decent amount of time but then we break up and we\\'re stuck in this program together? I don\\'t want things to be awkward. I don\\'t want the rumors and the drama and the appearance of unprofessional behavior. I don\\'t want the distraction from this very difficult program. When would I even find the time to attempt such a relationship?* There were just too many variables.\\nAfter a while, though, those questions and concerns seemed to matter less and less. They were still there, but I started to come around to the idea that I needed to do something. I couldn\\'t just have this crush and be in agony. I needed to act. I decided I would invite her out to hang out as friends, and if things went well, I would ask her out. Not a bad idea, right? I would look for signals and see if we have a real connection outside of school.\\nI saw her today at school. She came in and sat by me and another classmate, for no reason. She really just came in to hang out with us.  She\\'s done this several times, and this is part of the reason that I think there might be something there. *But is she coming in to see me or my classmate? Or am I overthinking this? I\\'m probably overthinking this.* \\nWe were working together for a few hours, but she says she has to stop real quick and let her friend in to the building. She mentions it\\'s a \"him.\" I immediately thought, *oh no. She\\'s going to bring in some tall, broad, stud of a smoke-show, and she\\'s going to show me what her type really is.*\\nI\\'m a skinny guy. I\\'m fit. I play sports. I have some decent muscle tone on my chest and abdomen, but I\\'m skinny. I don\\'t have big arms. I\\'m about 5\\'11\" (she\\'s actually about the same height as me.

I’ve reflected on my life, my memories, my past in general. I miss when I was a kid before I was bullied. I miss being happy and looking up to my mom thinking she was the most beautiful woman I’ve seen. I miss seeing her close the door behind her as she left the room knowing that I am loved. It doesn’t feel the same anymore, my relationship with her has deteriorated and every time I try to love her it’s like she does something that makes me cut myself and I try to push her away and away. I miss how I was able to see myself being happy forever. I’m popular now so I don’t get bullied and I’m attractive so I’m not called ugly anymore or get clowned at school. I have lots of “friends” (people I talk to daily but are more like close acquaintances) but I feel extremely lonely. The more time passes and I reflect on how I may have had depression for a very long time and suppressed it for so many years, possibly a decade if it’s possible to start feeling that way at 7. I don’t want to live anymore when most of my life has been filled with pain and redundancy. I tell myself “you’re never enough” but at this point it’s like a voice in my head that’s not mine but is also my own thoughts at the same time. If I weren’t alive anymore I wouldn’t feel and I wouldn’t have to suffer any longer. No more late nights crying in bed. No more cutting my forearms. No more waiting for the blood to clot so I don’t get blood all over my bed. No more of that sting that I feel when I take a shower and reminds me of the pain I go though on a daily basis.

I’ve also matured a lot faster than the regular person would; I had to, it was either maturing or ending up badly hurt and misunderstood. I am 21 now, but I feel like my maturity is years ahead of anyone my age, and this has given me an advantage in most areas. \\nObviously, depression also left me with scars, scars that I’m sure everyone reading this little block of text shares with me, and I want all of you to know that you should never be ashamed of those scars; wear them with pride because they are symbols of courage and strength.

I’ve been unemployed for 3 months now.  I’ve been stuck in the worst depression of my life with no motivation to find a job or source of education to move on to.  My depression has ebbed and flowed since my teen years, but I’ve never felt as beaten up and worthless as I do this time.  My wife and I love each other, but we haven't been intimate for 5 months now.  I can't look her in the eyes without seeing how useless of a husband and provider I've been.  I graduated university several years ago with a good-for-nothing Bachelor’s degree and I have worked in dead-end jobs with low wages ever since.  I still don’t know what I want to do for a career.  I have no formal education or relevant work experience to get a fulfilling job with good pay.  I’ve always been passionate about books, movies, tv shows, video games, and sports, but I can’t find any enjoyment from them anymore.  I haven’t had a good night’s sleep in years, so I spend all day being half asleep.  I can’t get anything productive done or participate in activities with others since I feel like I’m not playing with a full deck of cards.  I spend every day lying around feeling hopeless.  I’ve done some minor exercise which helps slightly.  I’ve been losing weight (which is good as I was overweight) mainly due to my diet as I have no appetite anymore.  For the first time, I’ve scheduled an appointment with a therapist which isn’t for another 1.5 months as that was the soonest available time slot.  Even with that on the horizon (assuming it helps me), I still find it difficult to deal with the fact that my current reality will have to exist until then.  I don’t know what else to do.  The list of things I need to get done keeps getting bigger as more life is sapped out of me.  I’m functioning each day with a sliver of the energy, motivation, brain power, and happiness that I know I’m capable of.  The past few months has gone by quicker than I ever thought possible with nothing to show from me.  I’ve been a burden to my wife, I’ve been lying to family/friends about my unemployment out of embarrassment, and every waking moment feels like torture.  I can’t see myself getting back into a regular day job, but I can’t keep burning through my savings either.  I see no bright path for me going forward or any way to attain happiness in life.

I have found my self being depressed and lonely for most of my life and it's become a part of me. A big part. - my depressing life story : I think it started back in middle school(grade 5) when I moved countries and came to north America. I was seen as an outsider by the other kids and targeted as a easy victim of playground bullying. I learned from it and even managed to start playing at lunch time with the same kids that bullied me by the time middle school came into its final year(grade 7). After this I would enter highschool and out of fear I befriended as many people as i could when i first joined. After grade 8 in highschool i would move to another highschool in a different city(and then again). In highschool i started sleeping 12 hours a day, i would sit on my phone in the washroom for an hour or more, i would take showers and baths for more than an hour. Basically I had turned myself off and with my family being as stressed as they were with their finances I became the emotional punching bag at home. Any frustration in our house would basically result in me getting an earfull(sometimes for 3-4 hours of me gettting yelled at and yes its me getting yelled at when 95% of the conversation is not me). Being emotionally turned off was extremely painful because i was a teenager trying to look for his place in the world and hoping for someone to take notice in me and give a fuck about me. As a result i began to be extremely closed off and would feel lonely no matter where i was or how many people were around me. After highschool we moved from canada to the states and life hit that reset button another time. It would be a good year of not having any friendships before i started college. And even with college i felt disadvantaged as all the other students had their own cars and wore much nicer clothes than i did(the yezees had just came out and i was the only one in the group without a pair). At this point i starting realizing that i was not necessarily privileged and that my parents had tried their best to keep me from that reality. The depression had caught up with my education as it always did and I was basically a moving peice of meat. I was completely absent in my mind and had latched on to smoking weed on a daily basis to make everything numb so i wouldnt feel the pain and i could ignore my own thoughts. Obviously this is not a good state for a student and i got kicked out of college with a gpa of 0.4...yes 0.4. I decided to move back to canada on my own and well its been a year and iv been through hell and back. I was abused right and left by employers. I couldn't even hold a job at McDonalds or at a grocery store. I worked in construction in the rain, the snow, the blaring sun and wind. I keep going through job after job and can never mange to get a rhythm that other adults seem to get into seamlessly. I borrowed thousands from my family just in the course of the past year and as of right now i dont even have enough credit to buy a decent meal let alone pay my rent. I feel like im hurting myself and everyone around me because im not emotionally stable enough to care for my self. Oooh and did i mention i have no friends or social life because well if i go out to grab a drink i cant even afford that. I think twice before buying a $2.50 bus ticket. I feel completely hopeless and lost. Im not necessarily suicidal but iv been suicidal many times before and thats probably the only reason I wont allow myself to be suicidal(basically i can see that road and i see it as a roundabout).

I knew the very things I needed to do to come out of the abyss. But, more than often, I couldn’t do it out of fear of uneasiness for change, or worse, no change at all. What if sadness was the most palpable aspect of my life and I was as much a goner without it as much as I was with it? Imagine going through years of emotional labour in therapy only to discover that you amount to nothing without your suffering. \\nMy purpose here is not to glorify sadness or mental illness in any form. I do not intend to justify destructive behaviour by means of this either. I just want to represent everyone who eludes happiness more often than happiness eludes them.

And I know that there\\'s much more I don\\'t remember.\\nEverytime I consider getting better, becoming that glowing example of who I know I can be, I think of all those atrocities which I have committed and I cower before the challenge of facing the consequences.\\nYet, I haven\\'t killed myself. \\nI havent killed myself. \\nI wonder why that is, it\\'s clearly a way out. Is it curiosity? Is it biology? Psychology? Sociology? What does science have to say about the fact that I\\'ve not offed myself yet?\\nI dont know, I havent checked. \\nI think a big reason I\\'m still alive is because I can just go to sleep instead of dying. I think my persistence is extended by the fact that sleep is like a temporary state of nonexistence. \\nI keep wondering if dying is like falling asleep. \\nWould I be awake for the moment I die like in the movies, or would I fall asleep and maybe even dream before I died? Would my last thought be a tear-filled \"Finally\" or a fear filled attempt to survive? \\nThese are a few of the thoughts that plague my attention-seeking, way too feely, overly dramatic, obviously faking it, mind. \\nI dont know how to help others see the severity. It probably seems like serenity. All I do is sleep, eat, shit, sleep some more, and occasionally I\\'ll even lift myself up enough to get out of bed just to get high and go out with friends. \\nMy existence should be the easiest in all of human history. I have all my needs met, my survival is barely a question. I dont understand it, why is it when I have everything I need that I dont want it? \\nIt\\'s ironic. I have more than my ancestors dreamed of, I see rocket ships fly off to space, I hold the answer to most of my questions in my pocket, hell I have all I need and I still want more.\\nAre we doomed to live forever wanting for the things we cannot have? Doomed to never appreciate that which we already have? Nothing good ever lasts. Why the hell is that? \\nI think we\\'re wanting creatures. I always want more, more, more, and just when I think I have enough, I need more just to keep my spirits up. \\nThe girls who like me are never enough, the things I accomplish are never enough, the possessions I have are never enough, the high I feel is never enough, the life I live is never enough. \\nWell I think I\\'ve had enough. I think we spend our young lives running after the best this and the best that, the hottest this and the cutest that, the highest high and the sweetest ass. \\nI think settling down is just that. I think its realizing that your own expectations of life are unrealistic and that life is much harder than you had previously imagined. \\nI feel like an icarus. I\\'ve flown too close to the sun and I cant run, I cant turn back now cuz I\\'ve already burned out and fallen down and I fell down hard.

My partner and I looked at each other with a combination of fear and excitement.\\nIt was 2017, we were 22 and had been together for a year and a half. We had just graduated and felt it was the perfect time to have a baby before settling into the world of work. All in all, it seemed like everything was going right.\\nIt was the first time in my life that I had felt complete. \\nThe day soon arrived when my partner and I were going to see our little baby for the first time, at our 12 week scan. We dressed up especially for it; I wore a suit and my partner wore a lovely dress. \\nAs we sat nervously in the waiting room at the Lancaster Royal Infirmary we shared baby name ideas. \\nIt was a beautiful day – up until the sonographer rolled the scanner across my partner’s stomach and eventually said, ‘I’m so sorry’.\\nWe asked what was wrong and she explained that there was an issue with the baby’s development. \\nWe were escorted into a grievance room and a consultant informed us our baby had a condition called encephalocele, which is where the skull never forms properly. \\nI asked whether there was any chance of survival but my fears were confirmed. Tears fell and I was completely numb. \\nMy partner and I sought a second opinion because we didn’t want to admit our baby was gone, but as soon as we were told we decided to accept a medical management procedure.\\nWitnessing my partner lose the child we had wanted so much is the most harrowing experience I have ever endured. I choke up just thinking about it. \\nAfter the procedure, I tried to remain strong for her. She was so brave and deserved somebody to reassure her everything would be OK. \\nHow could I have thought rationally at the time? Our baby had been taken away and there was nothing I could do.\\nAt the time we didn’t live together so I made it my duty to be with her as much as possible and we developed an inseparable bond. \\nBut I started to feel more and more depressed and couldn’t face being here any longer. I even considered taking my life. \\nEven so, I refused to seek help. I didn’t want to be a burden on my loved ones, especially my partner as she was battling with her own emotions. I worried that if I told my doctor I would be locked away. \\nI thought I could make the thoughts disappear in time, but after a while it became clear that this wasn’t going to happen. \\nIt was at this point I told my partner. I felt a weight lifted from my shoulders and she was incredibly supportive, even though she was disheartened that I had been keeping my feelings to myself. \\nWe both sought professional help from our doctors to help us come to terms with our loss.\\nEven though I was in the midst of a mental health crisis, I still now feel selfish for contemplating suicide when my partner needed me most. But how could I have thought rationally at the time? Our baby had been taken away and there was nothing I could do. \\nWe had a funeral service that only my partner and I attended. We scattered his ashes in the memorial garden at the crematorium. \\nI’m so grateful to have had my partner and we’ve since got married and become parents to a beautiful baby boy called Noah. \\nIt hasn’t been easy. During pregnancy with Noah, my partner and I were incredibly cautious. While I do have fond memories of Noah kicking my hand when I’d cuddle my wife, we were so anxious throughout that we didn’t really get to fully enjoy the experience. \\nAt each scan we would breathe a sigh of relief that we had reached another milestone. \\nWhen he was born I cried so hard – mostly at how proud I was of my wife and son, combined with all the emotion I had suppressed from the last pregnancy. \\nIt wasn’t until Noah was in my arms in the delivery room that we knew everything was going to be fine. \\nI often saw how great my friends were with their children and I didn’t get the same thrill and enjoyment.\\nYet I found it incredibly difficult to bond with Noah initially. I didn’t want to cuddle him or show him any affection. I didn’t feel normal. \\nI was petrified of bonding with him because I felt that if I lost him it would completely end me. I became a recluse and avoided interacting with anybody; I was only content when I was sleeping. I felt empty, as if I was merely existing. \\nMy wife quickly realised how detached I was from reality. Often she’d be talking to me and I’d blankly stare into space, not taking in anything being said. \\nI often saw how great my friends were with their children and I didn’t get the same thrill and enjoyment. I was upset as I felt surely I should be feeling the same way with my child. \\nWhen Noah was a couple of months old, my wife convinced me to see my doctor, who concluded I was dealing with postpartum depression.\\nBefore my diagnosis, I wasn’t even aware men could get postpartum depression. However, the doctor explained that I was normal, before prescribing me antidepressants and counselling sessions. \\nIn time, I gradually rebuilt my confidence and formed a bond with my beautiful and wonderful son. When we lost our first baby, it felt impossible to move forward and although I’ll never forget our first child, Noah brings that light back into my life.\\nHe’s nearly two now and so intelligent. He has so much love to give. Noah and my wife offer my life a sense of purpose and without them, I don’t know where I’d be. Since going through this experience, I’m much more open about my emotions with friends and family. \\nI vowed to my wife that when I got better I would try and help others do the same by showing them paternal postpartum depression does happen and you shouldn’t keep your feelings to yourself.\\nIn particular, I’ve raised funds and awareness of Tigerlily Trust, a local bereavement charity that supported my wife and I during our struggle. They provide tangible symbols of remembrance for parents bereaved through miscarriage, stillbirth or neonatal death. We hadn’t heard of them before, so having them show us love and support in our difficult time was heartwarming.  \\nIn time, my wife and I would love more children, but there will always be a sense of anxiety after our first experience. I’m a firm believer that time is a great healer, so for now, we are enjoying our beautiful son grow.\\nParents should be looking after themselves as much as they look after their little ones each day.', 'text_b': None, 'label': 1}, {'guid': 1747, 'text_a': 'Take Me Home :   I’ve been fighting, and fighting, and trying to understand, and trying to be understood, and I just…I can’t anymore. \\xa0I can’t. \\xa0I’ve tried so hard. \\xa0But everything, everything has been hard, and against me, right from the start. \\xa0I’ve never belonged anywhere, not even in my own family. \\xa0How many times they would say “Oh, that’s just how she is,” as if there was no other way to describe how other I was from the people who raised me. \\xa0I was so different from my parents, who had been raised in a single town, in a community, all their lives, with their sense of heritage and culture. \\xa0I was what I now know as a “third culture child.” \\xa0My siblings were third culture children too, but I was third culture from them, as well. \\xa0I was the only one who was born of a different parent. \\xa0They were all half siblings who got plenty attention from, and took after my stepfather, while he never spoke to me. \\xa0And my mother, who had remarried just to be able to support me, was secretly miserable and depressed, and never had the time or energy to speak to me either. \\xa0I was left to entertain myself in my room, constantly, and just shrugged off as unfathomable whenever I tried to talk to my parents. \\xa0No matter what age I was, from birth, to childhood, to adolescence, and now, adulthood; I’ve been forced to be alone, as we moved over and over again. \\xa0I was always alone, save for one point in my life, for a very short period of time. \\xa0I finally had a group of friends in middle school. \\xa0The one time I got to stay in a community for any significant length of time. \\xa0It was the happiest I had ever been. \\xa0When it was taken away from me, and we had to move again, that was my first major depression. \\xa0And I’ve just never recovered. \\xa0Ever since then, I’ve tried to find my home in other people. \\xa0I’ve tried to find that place again. \\xa0And again, and again, it’s fallen apart. \\xa0I can’t take the loneliness anymore. \\xa0My new partner is my last hope. \\xa0The last one. \\xa0Haven’t I said this before?

I’m gonna try to label the sections in all caps so if anyone wants to skip around they can. Also I’m on mobile so I’m sorry for the formatting )-: \\nINTRO: I (22f) attend a university in the US and am in a major where there’s only like 20 students in my “grade” (like freshman, sophomore, etc.) and we are all in the same classes together and have been for four years, so it’s hard to meet other people. We have all also had the same group of professors for four years. So we all are very familiar with each other. \\nI’m a senior and it is my last semester, I graduate this May. The head of the department is very involved and is making sure that each of us individually are on the track to graduating. \\nBACKGROUND: As a little background I have had severe anxiety and depression for as long as I can remember. I also have mild PTSD. I’m in a situation where my mom raised me by herself and was a great mom but also was incredibly verbally and emotionally abusive so I basically am terrified of confrontation, am a huge people pleaser, definitely do not do anything to stand out, and I follow directions and I do what I’m supposed to do (which is get decent grades, live independently and take care of my two pets, it just worked out that I work at a wonderful job that wants to take me on after I graduate, basically I’m just trying to be successful so my mom is proud of me). I have been seeing a therapist and psychiatrist actively and seeking treatment, but I have relapsed a handful of times. \\nThroughout my college career, it never fails that at some point in the semester there is a week or two where I fall into a depression pit and get too anxious to leave home but I still complete my projects (my major is VERY project based) and have never missed a deadline. I have never failed a class before. During these times I have been quite open with specific professors because there is an attendance policy in place where you can have 3 unexcused absences and after that your grade is affected. I have spoken so far to 3 professors and they have all been super wonderful and empathetic and willing to work with me. \\nFor my senior project, I am as far along as everyone else and continue to produce work even though my mental health has been suffering recently. My studio professor got hired about a year ago give or take and we have never had him before as a professor so none of the seniors know him well. The senior studios are split up into two classrooms, so there are two professors but we are all working on our final projects. My professor is incredibly rude and snarky and has an attitude with everybody. He has called students incompetent and told one particular girl that she didn’t have the ability to become our profession. He yelled at another student in front of everyone before. His work load is insane and way more work than the other senior studio. Today they just turned in a deadline that we turned in two weeks ago. Not only does he want us to work on our senior project but he wants to throw all kinds of extra assignments in there when that’s not the point of the class. It’s to do our final thesis project. \\nSITUATION: Recently I had missed a few weeks of school because I was going through intense shit with my mom, I was physically ill with the flu and then I got a sinus infection on top of that, but was keeping him updated. I got a note from an urgent care type place stating that I was ill with a flu like virus and I sent a picture of it to him in an email. I did not attend class the next day either because duh I have all the flu symptoms. I don’t think he counted that as excused because I didn’t get a note for that day, but I’m not going to pay $80 every day that I’m sick after they already prescribed me medicine and whatever just so I can get a note ???? \\nSo the following week goes by and I’m not getting any better and am getting more symptoms of a sinus infection. Great. Obviously I didn’t go to class. This is where I messed up because I should have gone to the doctor sooner to get an excuse I guess. \\nI was emailing him and telling him that I wasn’t going to class and as we were just working on our projects for the upcoming deadline this literal entire time, I didn’t need to physically be there because I have the software I need for it on my laptop. So I am continuing to work on my project this whooole time. The deadline was that Friday and we were presenting in front of the class and a guest. I was still ill but sucked it up bc it was a presentation. I went to school early to print my project and my sweet boyfriend drove me because he knew I was having a hard time. So I didn’t bring my wallet. Big accident. I went to print my presentation at our printing lab(11 x 17 sheets) and after a freaking insane amount of time wasted because the front desk people weren’t there, I realized that they only take the school cash and my school ID was in my wallet at home. At this point class had already started and I was PANICKING. I could feel my face getting hot and my body shaking. I went outside to get some cool air but it did not help. I was having a panic attack and crying and hyperventilating. I called my boyfriend and said screw this come pick me up because I’m not going in empty handed to explain why I have no presentation while I’m full on sobbing in front of my peers and a guest. \\nI did send him an email before I left and explained what happened. I was SO embarrassed. I profusely apologized, accepted a grade penalty, and explained my mental health issues because this had to do with that and I’ve been able to be open with professors of the same college before with no problem. He didn’t email me back ever, which I was like what the fuck because that was a serious email. \\nSo the next Monday I’m still feeling like shit so I go to the on campus doctor. I have a sinus infection, my ears are clogged so i can’t hear, snot is constantly falling from my nose, I’m constantly coughing. It’s gross. While I’m there I figure I will get a note to excuse last week. The doctor wrote that I was ill last week and the day that I came in, signed and dated it. I sent my professor this email to explain why I was so sick and again he didn’t answer me. \\nFast forward to a few days later and my antibiotics aren’t working. The doctor had prescribed me amoxicillin but I do better with augmentin. I should have mentioned that to him but it didn’t occur to me. I emailed him this note bc it was on the day of class and said my antibiotics are not working this is why I’m not in class. He did not respond for a third time and stated that I would be attending class that Friday. At this point I’m freaking out. He’s purposely ignoring me and I was still incredibly embarrassed and shameful about my panic attack at school so this was just making it worse. \\nThat Friday I did not go. I know I told him I would. But I can honestly say that I didn’t go because of how fucking anxious I was to see his reaction to me. \\nI was a wreck the whole weekend. I cried so hard, had several panic attacks and it was overall not a fun time. My poor boyfriend was doing his best to try to comfort me. He is the only person I talk to other than my therapist. I don’t have any other friends because nobody in my major likes me because of the fact that I miss class a lot and am generally really quiet. My mom has told me its my fault they don’t like me. \\nHe actually ended up cancelling class on that Monday which was a relief for me! So I went on Wednesday. I talked to my therapist that morning and we had planned that I would go in at the start of class and bring him my notes and tell him I wanted to show him my project. I went to go pull out my laptop and pulled up my project to discuss it with him. He came up to me and asked me if these notes were the ones I emailed him. I said yes, I brought them because you never responded to me and I wanted to make sure you got them. He said with an attitude “well you have a lot of unexcused absences”. I started to say something but I only got out “I can-“ at which point he cut me off and said (while there were other students around bc we were at my desk) “I don’t know what you’re going to do but you’re not going to pass”, and this part is fuzzy because I was already blindsided at this point, but he said something to the effect of “and fix whatever else is going on” which I took personally as a jab at my mental health. and then walked away from me and proceeded to call another student up to him to discuss their project. \\nI sat there in disbelief. What the fuck. Right? What the fuck? If I don’t pass this class I will not graduate. If I don’t graduate I lose my job. My family will be SO disappointed, especially my mother who is taking on debt for me to attend college. I sat there for a few minutes and tried to work. I could feel myself getting worked up and I could feel the panic coming. My eyes started watering and I had to get the fuck out of there.  I went outside and didn’t know what to do. I couldn’t call my boyfriend because I knew he was in an exam at the time. I tried calling my therapist but she didn’t answer which I totally understand because she’s super busy but I thought I would try anyways. \\nI took a walk around campus to try to calm down but I eventually ended up behind some dumpsters sobbing and hyperventilating. I called my dad who I have a great relationship with now (not so much when I was younger) and he was really supportive, he talked to me until my boyfriend got out of his exam and could drive me home. \\nI’m at a loss. I attended work the next day and broke down there. They sent me home. I spent the whole day hating myself and sobbing. I have one friend in my major who I consider a very close friend if not my best friend even if I’m not hers. We have been friends for 3 years and she knows almost every detail of my life. I told her about this and she said I needed to meet with the head of our major. She helped me organize my thoughts and write out an email and I sent it last night. \\nNow it’s today and I woke up crying, I genuinely had for the first time suicidal thoughts. My head was pounding and I couldn’t stop obsessing over this. My therapist called me and talked with me for 10 minutes which I appreciate more than she will ever know. She literally talked me off the ledge, she called me while I was sobbing. \\nFast forward and I grew some balls and went to studio. I went straight to my desk and my friend who sits across from me completely ignored me. She didn’t look at me or anything even when I spoke to her directly (which was really only a little conversation but she avoided eye contact) So I just worked on my stuff the whole studio, which is 4 hours long. I wanted to just work on my project but something unexpected happened and my professor assigned an assignment that was due at the end of class, something that he never does. I think he did this bc he thought I wouldn’t be there today. He avoided looking at me the entire class and when he went around to everyone’s desks he went to mine last. Our assignment was to hand draw 5 separate detailed items of our project. He told us a specific example to use, which coincidentally I was already thinking of doing, so I drew it. He came over to me and told me he didn’t get why I put it there and what it has to do with anything. Then he went to the girl next to me and she was like “I don’t know what to draw” and he told her she could draw what I just fucking drew. At the end of class he went around again and spoke to everyone again once except me. \\nAnd now here I am. I really don’t know what to do. I hate myself because I know this situation is my fault and I should have just gone to class. If you made it this far I really really appreciate it.

I feel like I'm living to work and most of the time I'm waking up early, working all day, getting home and by the time I've had dinner and done the washing up I'm too tired to be bothered to do anything.\\nEvery time I try to pursue a hobby I quickly lose interest or get bored. I like boxing so sometimes go to an amateur boxing club near me. Even though the coaches are nice guys, the quality of training isn't great. I know I shouldn't expect too much because it's super cheap like £5 for 3 hour and a half sessions a week but I can't afford much else and don't particularly enjoy it or feel I'm making progress. Before I moved in with my girlfriend and her family I used to go to another boxing club. I much preferred it there - I really liked the coaches, the structure of the sessions and there was a good sense of camaraderie; I made a few friends there but it's too far to travel now. Besides, my parents didn't like me going there because I had a few white collar bouts and admittedly I'm not very good at boxing so I won once but got quite badly beaten up twice and ended up needing a brain scan in hospital. It goes back to this feeling of futility because even though I enjoy it what is the point if I'm not very good? At one point I was going 5 or 6 times a week and I still wasn't great.\\nI also like music (going to gigs and playing guitar), running, weightlifting, football (soccer), reading and paying my Nintendo Switch. But recently none of these have been holding my attention and I've been losing interest really quickly. For example I start learning to play a song on guitar and don't get round to practicing for a few days so forget it and move on to another song. I'll start trying to run 2 or 3 times a week to improve my 5k time then I'll be lazy and not bother for 2 weeks. I've been getting better with the weightlifting but similarly I'll miss a few sessions and feel like I'm back at square one. With football I'm so disinterested I won't even watch my team play or bother catching the highlights. With reading I won't get past the first few chapters of a book, and even with playing my Nintendo Switch I'll start a game and get bored.\\nI feel like any hobby I pick up is pointless and I'm never going to get anywhere with it because I started too late (I'm 23 now).

To start, I was neglected by my parents. they where never mean, they didn\\'t let me go hungry, they didn\\'t ignore me, in fact i\\'m still living with them,  they just never pushed me to do anything... ever. When I was 12 they pulled me out of school to move to another state and simply never put me back in school. my dad tried homeschooling me for a month or two but quickly gave up.\\nBecause of this I grew up very shy of other people and never had much luck making friends. I spent my teens mostly in my room playing games, watching movies and not much else. I was very isolated. I can\\'t decide how much blame to level against myself for this. How much should a 15 year old be blamed for not enrolling himself in high school, especially when it doesn\\'t seem to matter to anyone around him?\\nSimilarly they never pushed me to get a job and so i just... never did.I did go to film school (which is a whole, long, sad, depressing story in and of it\\'s self) but nothing came of it. I also spent a few months looking for work but didn\\'t get so much as an email back from anyone. I guess it\\'s not hard to see why when you, an employer, are looking at a 28 year old with no work experience...\\nAbout the only good thing that came out of this was meeting my long time boyfriend which leads me to the second major thing. I met him on line when i was 17 and we\\'ve been together for about a decade now. long distance relationships are hard, but it\\'s even harder to sustain one for so long. I love him more than anything and love being around him. Every year one of us goes to visit the other for a few months and they have been some of the happiest times in my life. that being said there have been some extremely hard times, not the least of which was when he cheated on me.\\nhe\\'s always bee very sexual so I suppose I should have known what I was getting myself into. We had a semi open relationship. it wasn\\'t my idea and after years of arguing we came to a compromise. blowjobs only. it upset me but seemed almost necessary. we only see each other once a year, we where both young and horny (one of us hornier than the other) and it seemed like a fair compromise to let him explore with other people since he couldn\\'t do it with me.\\nHe started becoming infatuated with one of his friends. he told me over and over again that it was nothing serious. i really believe he thought that because one day he came to me, told me that I was right and said he was backing off and told his friend to do this same. about a year later he cheated on me with him multiple times. he broke our rule which he knew i was already not a fan of.\\nwhat you need to understand is, the last two paragraphs take place over years. when ever he would go out with his friends i was always left alone to wonder what he\\'s doing with them. it was constant torture and that\\'s before he cheated on me, and he knew that. it didn\\'t help anything that he was surrounded by people to play around with but I wasn\\'t. I only had him. I\\'m 28 and have only ever been with four people including him. the other three where out of desperation. A way to back at/keep up with him and the only way to, at least in some part, blow off some of that frustration and anger. because of that, it was always awkward and I only saw one of them more than once. I really started to grow to hate sex.\\nwhen he cheated on me it destroyed me. it was the lowest moment in my life. No one to talk to, no real friends, no guidance, nothing. We spent months trying to patch things up. I still loved him and cared about him and didn\\'t want to be without him so... i decided to open the relationship entirely. My only rule was to use a condom (Which he hadn\\'t been). I feel like a door mat... he cheated on me and i rewarded him by not only letting him keep hanging out with the guy (who he says is his best friend) but also let him keep sleeping with him. whenever i was out of contact with him because he was out with his friends my depression and jealousy was crippling. I tore my room apart, was always angry, and was just generally out of control of my own brain.\\nI even tried to see a shrink during this time who ignored the things i wanted to talk about, didn\\'t seem to care at all about this mess, kept fucking up my billing and forgetting to schedule appointments.\\nThe time of year came when we would see each other and it was decided i would go to him this time. he thought if I met the guy that i wouldn\\'t feel so bad. I spent three months there. it was incredibly awkward with his friends and especially that guy. the trip was very stressful. His so called \"best friend\" was a huge dick and constantly made a problem of himself to the point of even my boyfriend losing it on multiple occasions. After the whole mess my boyfriend said he really doesn\\'t blame me for hating him.\\ndespite that, our relationship got back on track. we where doing really well. this was going to be the first year we spent Christmas together. I went there in the summer, then a few months later he came here for Christmas. in between, he put the open part of our relationship on hold which made me really happy.\\nbut now Christmas is over and he\\'s gone back home and we\\'re not sure when we\\'ll see each other again. we\\'re trying to get married but international marriage is difficult and we\\'re currently at a loss. it\\'s always hard when we separate after months together but this time has been much harder. we don\\'t know when we\\'ll see each other again, both of us are very stressed out trying to bring our lives together while also trying to support ourselves individually and, for me, on top of it is the memory of the place i was in last year and i feel myself sliding back to the anger and jealousy. I know it\\'s only a matter of time before he starts fooling around again and i know he\\'s already trying to open the possibility with more of his friends.\\nI don\\'t know how to handle this anymore. i\\'m tired of only having myself to talk to. i\\'m tired of feeling walked on. i\\'m tired of feeling like, even if i wanted to, i don\\'t have the life or personality that would let me participate in this openness.\\nI really do love him and i know he really loves me. When we\\'re together we\\'re inseparable and do EVERYTHING together. but when we\\'re apart it\\'s like i become less important to his life... maybe it\\'s just his defense mechanism for dealing with the distance but when we separate all i want to do is cling to him, he seems to pull away and it\\'s a lot of work to keep things together.\\nSo, my situation is, i\\'m 28, living with my parents, never had a job, have no life skills and very little social skills. I\\'m in a long distance relationship with someone i love more than anything but he cheated on me and is now back home with his friends who, any one of them could be the next person.

The whole time through our texts just felt like she was pushing me away so I decided \"f this, I can\\'t deal with this right now.\" I end up leaving work early and drive the hour and a half around 4PM last saturday.\\nI call her pulled into the college dorm parking lot saying \"Im sorry, I didnt want to facetime or text about all of this and I know we said we would after work but long story short I drove out and im in the parking lot.\"\\nShe reads my text and calls me 3 minutes later, the suspense feels like I just ruined everything... she calls and says shes not there, that she is out at dinner with friends and doesnt know when she will get back. I told her Im sorry and that I can leave, she says its up to me when I without hesitation say \"I want to talk to you... I want to see you...\" She pauses and says okay, she texts saying shes sorry and that shes just in shock but is excited to see me.\\n50 minutes pass and she pulls in and walks to my car since she randomly pulls next to me. we just kind of laugh before I hug her and we quietly walk up to her dorm where we begin talking about everything.\\nShe tells me while trying not to cry that she doesnt want me to deal with her and that she really likes me and feels like she will hurt me. In summary, we let some of our emotions out and end up cuddling again before we see her friends for a bit, she feels closer to me and more open now, I end up leaving and tell her thank you for not flat our rejecting me. I knew it was 50/50 but if what I felt like I knew about her was true, I knew she wouldn\\'t reject seeing and talking to me in person.\\nAs I drove home that night, I get pulled over for going 87 in a 70 by an officer and am hit with a $250 ticket. I get home around 2AM and tell her I miss her and begin to be super overbearing again. I tell her I got a ticket and Im sorry if Im waking her up and that if I ruined her image of me by getting a ticket since this was my first ever run in with the police and I didnt know what to do or say, all I could think about was how she would see me.\\nShe waited up the 2 hours at night for me to get home safe and says I didnt ruin anything and that she really liked seeing me and to have a good sleep. I woke up and proceeded to text her goodmorning and thank you for not pushing me away and kept telling her how she makes me feel. I am a triple scorpio if anyone believes in or knows what that is and I am extremely ambitious and passionate but with that comes impatience and a great need for discipline while she is a virgo.\\nShe relapses back to the hesitation and we text very lightly, just seems like we were friends and that she felt afraid that she was opening up to me and letting me in her life.\\nthe week goes by and she tells me shes sorry I have to deal with her, that she really likes me and sees something with me and is afraid since shes never been treated nice in the past before. I try to hold myself back and just say its okay and that I care about her, we keep telling eachother through the week how much we mean to one another and how crazy it is that we just met.\\nWe facetime on tuesday and she says she just wanted to talk about her feelings and we get really deep into our lives, where we want to be, how we feel about eachother, the whole shabang. We end the call and she tells me that talking to me made her feel a lot better about everything and that she wanted me to come over tomorrow (aka wednesday, few days ago) everything is feeling better and I drive out after my classes to be with her, we just cuddle for a few hours and talk more about what we want and how we see eachother where she asks me if I can be hers, and that if we are officially dating she will feel way better about everything. I just smile and say ofcourse before kissing her and we begin to makeout before we go bowling with her friend group.\\nAll of her friends really like me and we click super well, I feel integrated except with one girl who is overly dramatic with everyone.\\nI leave and tell her thanks for the great night and that Ill text her when I get home. Luckily no ticket this time and we say goodnight as she still waits up for me when she didnt need to. (was a school night for her) we plan to hangout on the weekend which is where we are now.\\nI drove over yesterday after work (friday) and we spend the day with eachother. We cuddle and go on a triple date with her friends and their gf/bf\\'s, we laugh how cringey it is but we are so happy together, nothing seems weird and we go back to her dorm that night after hanging out with everybody and I asked if its still okay if I sleep over, she says ofcourse and we get comfy and get to bed.\\nI begin talking to her and asking her how she stills feels etc. and she talks about how she feels safe and happy with me and that she needs time. we makeout and I go a lot farther than we both thought I would intimately, no sex which is fine since if we ever do make love I never want her to feel like its something to regret. This is where I make the mistake that I need advice with...\\nEarly in the night she talks about love and how she views it. She is very practical and says there is no love at first sight, that she was in love once but from being completely rejected had completely damaged her. That there is only infatuation and love is a two way thing.\\nI tell her around 1am yesterday (or today however you view it) that I dont just feel infatuated, I didnt say it but she knew, she immediately stopped me and said, \"No, dont say that...\" I get stressed out and she says I didnt ruin anything but she doesnt feel the same way, that I barely know her and that she wants to take it slow. We makeout again etc and fondle eachother blah blah.\\nI ask her every question I have had building up and let myself go, I give up and feel completely destroyed as how attached I have grown to her. I recognize I fall hard and she knows that and tells me that. She says she sees something long term with me and how she knows her family would love me and wouldnt be trying to make us work if she didnt see a future with me, that she really cares about me but doesnt want to feel any regret and make any mistakes.\\nwe go to bed and she wakes me up about an hour later just kissing me and moving my hand under her shirt etc until I become fully awake and try to go for it, I move my fingers down below where she stops me and says, \"fuck you\" in her beautiful and snarky voice, that she hates me (jokingly) I say why? and she says because I know what Im doing, and that I am making it very difficult to hold back and she needs my help. I stop and we go back to bed for real this time after I say sorry for saying \"the thing\" she says its okay and that it didnt happen.\\nShe wakes up before me and starts kissing me again while Im asleep and does the same thing where we are just enjoying eacothers touch feel that sense of physicality and love. I subconsciously say \"I love you\" which freaks her out.\\nKeep in mind I do remember saying this but I was half awake and fell asleep almost instantly after saying it, I didnt really know if she heard me or not, it just came out, it is how I feeland have been feeling and been trying so hard not to say. \\nShe goes blank faced for the next hour until I wake up and see her so distraught, I ask whats wrong, (This is this morning by the way) until she says I am stupid, I didnt mean it, I dont know her and I dont know what love is. I just sit there with my heart aching. I say I was asleep and didnt mean it and that Im sorry. She says its okay and we proceed to cuddle in until 11:40AM on and off making out and teasing eachother knowing we cant do anything because it was too soon. I say Im sorry for ruining any other chance of coming over and she says its okay, and \"You didnt say anything, were okay.\"\\nWe go out to lunch with her friends and everything feels find, she doesnt feel like shes rejecting me or weird in any ways, just her normal smiley happy self. We get back and we cuddle again before we both fall asleep for 3 hours, I dreamt about her and was still so destroyed and didnt know how to feel. \\nFor the longest time even though I am not religious I had felt that I am just some NPC being controlled by god and the devil letting fate control my journey until I met this girl and chose to make my own decisions, that I cant wait around for anything and that this girl is someone I can see myself being with for the rest of my life no matter how early it may be.\\nwe wake up and I get ready to leave since she wants to hang out with her friends alone later since the one over dramatic friend earlier is jealous that she found someone and that everyone but her is dating somebody. I say sorry one more time and I can tell she is hiding how she is feeling, that she will end up rejecting the feelings again no matter how real they may seem to me. We say bye and she says text me when I get home\\nNow we are here. 8:50PM Saturday 3/7/2020... This is how the convo goes and keep in mind I can tell she is ignoring how she feels and doesnt want to think about anything I tried to tell her\\nMe: Made it home\\nMadlad: okay good :)\\nMe: Hope things are good with your friends\\nMadlad: not really but hope she will be\\nMe: yeah... Thanks for the fun weekend madlad, I know I made it go downhill but that is the lowest it could go, everything going forward will be better I promise. You have really been trusting of me, I know you are going really fast which is why its my turn to slow down so its not you doing all of the work, everythings alreadu out and said so the last thing is just time. Have a goodnight madlad, ill stop spamming you and stuff, you really mean a lot to me.\\nMadlad: thank you knarsan. I had a fun weekend to (heart face emoji)\\n20 minutes later Madlad: my friend ditched on us.\\nMe: Im sorry, what are you up to the rest of the night\\nMadlad: its whatever lol, we are doing shots and watching movies lol\\nMe: cool (I dont drink by the way, not trying to be judgemental, I just dont really participate in the subculture and can come off as a dick a lot of the time reddit :/ )\\nMadlad: whats wrong\\nMe: nothings wrong haha be safe! (Im saying this while typing this thing out and slowly dying inside, I am currently listening to biggie smalls ready to die album and Electric Light Orchestras Out of the Blue album while crying.)\\nMadlad: Ill be safe (heart emoji)\\nMe: (the stupid little excited/smile emoji)\\nMadlad: Im gonna get shitfaced I think\\n\\\\- I read this but dont really know what to respond so dont\\n3 min later Madlad: im sorry I drink lol\\nMe: you dont have any reason to be sorry, im sorry I make you feel like im judging you on that.\\nMadlad: you dont I just dont want you to think less of me\\nMe: I dont (Still dying inside)\\nMe: I just care about you, If I judged you on every little thing I dont think you would want to be with me\\nMadlad: I care about you too, Ill be safe\\nI didnt respond to this and thats the end of the story, its now 9:05PM and I am completely lost and dont know how to feel, what to do, how to react, how I should feel, how she wants me to feel etc.\\nI overthink and I am a love addict by nature, I am not ashamed of it but I am starting to be, I am learning and experiencing something new and really want this all to work but I dont know what to do... I could really use some sort of guide or just something\\nI do love her, thats why im so hurt, I dont want to push her away but this constant self torment destroys me and makes me want to look over the gorge\\'s of vermont and contemplate whether I am worth it for anyone, if I will ever feel the loving embrace of someone. I know I am probably over reacting but I am struggling to battle with myself and dont know who to tell since I in reality have no friends I would trust.\\nShe has trust issues and I never wanted to tell her I did to since that would push her away, I am compeltely open to sharing myself with her which is why I dont have the same problems as her and im definitely going through the weight of loneliness and depression while she is battling the way of people and what others could do to possibly hurt her again.

This diagnosis caused me to be separated from the military. At the time I was ok with it. I felt that it was just a sign to move on to another stage of my life. From there I decided to go back to school. I wanted to finish my degree and get a job using that degree. This would have went well but unforeseen circumstances have caused some major issues with that plan. The school isn’t offering the classes that I need to finish the degree for at least a term for one and two for the other courses. With school being payed by the VA and them also providing a housing allowance this was my source of income, but I can’t get that in on if I’m not going to school. I was fully prepared to cut down on spending while I waited to find a job to tide me over. I am married and my wife has a steady job so at least we have some income, but I have been the only one to cut down on the spending. While trying to get my wife to cut down a little bit on spending, she decided to get an additional job to earn a little extra money. Initially I was very happy with that. The thing is she has been always working and I am struggling to get a job. The bills were fine initially but eventually credit card began having higher and higher balances and the savings began dwindling. My wife has been using her second job not to assist in paying the bills but to sequester away to use as fun money. Again no issue initially. Over time it was notice that more an more time and money was spent towards time with her friends while I ended up stuck at home based on the fact that money was leaving faster than it was coming in. I have asked to be included, but she tells me she doesn’t want my negativity around her friends. This hurt me and made me take a close look at the situation. The past year or so communication has really been almost nonexistent between us about the happenings of our lives. This was ok when I was In The military because I spent a large portion of my time at work. I really wanted to push towards better communication and time together when we could get it without cutting out her friends.  I began working my communication while I was busy with school. I made sure to tell her when I had free time so that we could spend time together. Multiple times that I let her know that I was going to be free on a specific day or that I would make time to spend with her when I knew she was free, she would instead make plans with her friends. Time after time of this happening has just beat me down emotionally. It’s even more noticeable now that I am home all the time job hunting and I still get to see my wife less then her friends see her. The combination of the situations that put me in an idle state and it seeming like she doesn’t want to be around me has put me in a very dark place. I have been seeing a counselor with her over the past couple of months in hopes of rebuilding the communication bridge and trying to get her to see how I feel and me to see how she feels about everything. The thing is that whenever a conversation about such things happens between us she glazes over and it seems like no attention is being payed. This again bashed my self worth. The counselor eventually referred me to a medical professional who diagnosed me with major depression and prescribed me medication. The medication helps for the most part, but I keep getting lack of value impressions from my wife that just puts me right back in my hole. Over the past few months I have thought about suicide many many times. I have never thought about doing it, just about how I could do it. This scares the crap out of me. It takes a lot of thinking about my parents and my sister to get those negative thoughts out of my head. I am at a loss though I love my wife so much, and I think my wife loves me in her own way. The thing is us not being on the same page is destroying me, and in turn our relationship. I know it’s not all my fault and that it’s not all hers, it is a combination of everything. I feel like I have been bending over backwards to promote healing in my life and my relationship with my wife. I don’t feel that I am getting the effort back from my wife. I am at a loss of what to do. I can’t seem to dig myself out of this hole and I can’t seem to get the help from my wife because neither of us know how.

I then realized I've known her since third grade she just had blond hair and a gap in her teeth (with at the time I thought was cute) and she still has her speech impediment which I think is cute also. She then remembers me, and I asked christian if they we're dating and he said no, I then asked if he cared if I flirted with her, he said no again. I start to flirt and she flirted back. After some talking we started to talk and he watched us make out which was really weird. Christian, Sage,Christian's sister Karli, and I went to the local park and just messed around because no one was there me and sage were talking and hanging around and I guess christian got mad so he wanted to talk to Karli, so Karli told sage and me to go to the baseball dugout  and when we did we looked around and played tic-tac-toe on the wall and then I picked her up ( mind you I'm 5'8 and she is around 5'3ish) and have her put her legs around my waist and I pinned her against a wall and we made out for a while.

So in 11th and 12th grade I tried instead very hard in learning even more math, doing both the IB higher level and Further level Maths.

I use music to distract myself when I am alone. I have sort of isolated myself socially too.

I don't know why but it seems like I cry at any point - nothing has to be triggering me, tears just form and that's that. I've been unhappy for a few months but never believed it to be serious. I've talked to a few counselors about anxiety which is something I've been dealing with for about 2 years. It has gotten significantly bad over the last few months.

I was prescribed antibiotics, but they did not work so I was referred to a specialist who provided me with drops and I was signed off work. The drops cleared the infection but I was still having issues with my hearing, after seeing the specialist the second time I was told that both of my eardrums had chronic perforations and that unless I had surgery I would not be able to hear properly again and there was a 25% chance that even with surgery I would not regain the hearing I had lost. \\nWhen I exited the hospital, I broke down in the street, I was sobbing into my sleeve as I walked, and I was at a total loss of what to do. I had been having negative thoughts for a long while, but I had been able to lift myself from them but now they seemed to be hitting me hard and I began to feel that life just was not worth living.\\nI went home and kept having suicidal thoughts, I kept thinking of ways to end my life without affecting my husband financially, ways in which my death would look accidental in nature. I was home alone for weeks thinking about ways to end my life and I was hiding it from my husband. I did not want to hurt him, for him to see me as a burden in his life or for him to think I was weak and a failure. I kept receiving emails about my situation from work and weeks turned to months and I began to dread having to go to the doctor to ask for a sicknote (which he was more than happy to provide). I lost all purpose and felt like there was nothing in life that I wanted to do. I would make comments about how the anaesthetic from the surgery for my ears might go wrong and then I would not have to think about any of this.\\nIt all came to a head when I was due to return to work and I asked my husband if he could see himself continuing with the same job and he said yes and I looked him in the eyes and simply said I can’t do it anymore. Unfortunately, the timing of this was very poor as we were due to have guests around and he could see that I was in severe distress, but it was too late to cancel. I managed to hold back and after the guests left, we spent the whole night talking, much of which was me sobbing hard about how I did not want to continue to be alive. My whole body hurt; I had been trembling which meant my muscles were sore. My eyes were raw from the tears and from rubbing them. My throat hurt from the gasps of anguish and crying as I explained my issues.\\nMy husband took me to see my GP the next morning and I found it difficult to start the conversation. My husband began and as he told the GP he burst into tears and it broke me again. I don’t think I have ever seen my husband cry. It hurt me to the core to see him so upset. The GP was shocked and immediately prescribed me with antidepressants and information for counselling and support.\\nSince then my mood has been up and down, I try to think about the future but its very hard to be positive or think of things I want to do or achieve. I hate being off work as it makes me feel like a burden, even though I was receiving sick pay and my company is supportive I just wanted to get it over with and continue with my life but the only issue I kept coming up against was doing what? I have no idea.\\nThe feelings of being a burden kept growing stronger, especially as I knew the sick pay would be reduced to half and then I would be financially dependant on my husband which I feel to be unfair and has never happened in the 13 years we have been together. I have worked hard to try and find something I love enough to consider the possibility of doing as a career, but it is a real struggle. I also wanted to try coming off the medication in order to be less drowsy the following day so I could get more things done so I stopped taking it (for two weeks). I decided that as I love animals, I would try home boarding as an option and in order to relive myself of the pressure to return to my old job I handed in my resignation. My employer was very reluctant to accept the resignation but I honestly did not see me ever being able to return to that role and if I did I am sure that the feelings would build up again and I would end up in the same position. \\nMy first experience of home boarding was awful, within an hour of receiving the dog I felt pressured, stressed and anxious so much so that I ended up in tears and back on my medication, I was constantly berating myself. The owner stated the dog was house trained and friendly to other dogs (I have two dogs myself) but this was not true, and I was having to juggle a very energetic animal with my own pets. My husband kept offering to help but as he had been working all week, I kept telling him no, that this was my responsibility as he had already done his working week. But I couldn’t cope. The dog managed to run upstairs and peed on the spare bed which again caused me to get upset. The dog was uncontrollable, unresponsive to commands and not house trained; the idea to be a home boarder now felt horrible and I recalled handing in my notice and asking myself “what have I done?” The dog also had separation anxiety and I did not want this to affect both me and my husband so I slept in a separate bed with the dog in the room, shushing it every 30 minutes and hoping it did not rip up the carpet, skirting, door or anything else. Needless to say, I did not sleep well that night. \\nThe next day I asked my employer if it would be possible to rescind my  resignation and assign me to a part time position, on a lower grade with lesser responsibilities but as I have offered my resignation it is up to them if they accept this. I know my husband will support me to find a new job, so this is not an issue for me, but I still feel reckless for just leaving to try something new without having tried it first. I guess it is a lesson learnt.\\nIn all this time I have been on group therapy sessions, received counselling and have used the support service ‘shout!’ and have been more open about my feelings with my husband when I am having a particularly bad day. I realised how much I love to write, and I am now considering looking at this as a possible career in the future. I am going to take one day at a time and explore the opportunities I have available to me and I will go back to work even if it is part time whilst I decide what I really want to do.\\nI can’t say that I am cured but I do feel that I have made some progress. Without talking to my husband as scary as it was or going to my GP to seek support, I don’t think I would be here today. I urge anyone who has felt like I have, to seek help.

The feeling of being complete and loving yourself. Some things I think about: Im sexiest mothefucker out there, I have a perfect life, im in perfect health, im the greatest of all time. Im blessed. You should be feeling this loving energy near your heart. It feels good kinda blissful. Just let go and feel that you have everything. You are not thinking about anything negative. Its basically metta meditation. The longer your session the better it is for you. Soon you will start seeing changes with your life. Everything starts with you.\\nThis technique will make you a more positive person and you will start feeling happy for no reason. You will start spreading love instead of taking it because once you truly love yourself. You become a beacon. A beacon of love and people will be attracted to it. Good things will start happening.\\nEven if this sounds crazy, would you rather do nothing and willow in despair or give this weird thing a shot.\", 'text_b': None, 'label': 1}, {'guid': 1983, 'text_a': \"Am I just sad? : So my initial post was to tell my story, how I recently lost my faith, unemployed, single (let down every time) and whatever else I could drag in to paint the picture.\\nI never understood depression growing up but didn't hear much about it also.

So I decided to help the people that are not feeling happy. (Not being happy can have many causes therefore I can not guarantee that the method that I am going to explain will help for everyone.)\\nFirst of all I want to say that I do not recommend you to suppress your emotions. Feeling emotions can be helpful in many ways. It can for example tell you that you do not like certain things or that certain things need to be changed. But as a child probably almost everyone told you ¨I want you to be happy¨. Therefore you started to feel bad if you did not feel happy. So you feel even more bad than you did before. But like I just said, your emotions can be helpful in many ways. So you do not have to feel bad about it if you are not happy.\\nIn today's society most people are raised in a way that they start thinking constantly. And if you observe these thinking patterns you start to see that most people are just repeating their thoughts over and over again. And at a point they even start thinking about their own created thoughts that they are repeating over and over again. Therefore they have nothing to think about except thoughts. And then there comes a point that they are just living in their head. And because of that they are not seeing the beauty of life anymore. People can go to work everyday and if you ask them for example ¨Did you see the appletree at the side of the road when you was on your way to work?¨ They will probably say ´´No I didn't see it´´. So they are just caught up in their thoughts not experiencing life anymore. So try to still your mind, by for example meditation (If you want mediation techniques, feel free to ask, you can even send me a dm @quintenvanommen.) Once your are not caught up in your thoughts anymore you can start experiencing life again. On your way to work you can see the appletree, you can see the apples, you can see the apples falling. And if you eat you are just eating. Your are experiencing the apple or whatever you are eating. And than if you drink afterwards a cup of tea for example. Just drink the cup of tea and taste the tea.

That's why I'm going to try to divide my post into different sections this time in an attempt to make grasping everything easier for you (the reader) and myself to be completely honest.\\n**the sections:**\\n* The relationship\\n* Her situation/depression\\n* My final decision\\n# the relationship\\nMy girlfriend (18) and I (18) started dating 2 years ago at 16 back in high school. We've had a very turbulent relationship with a lot of breaking and making up, intense love and our fair share of troubles. Maybe I'm just romanticizing the word toxicity but to be completely honest I wouldn't have wanted it any other way.\\nWe used to be extremely jealous of each other and sort of isolated our self from the world together. Thinking back I do regret this a lot. Due to our mix of toxicity and her depression we both suffered abuse from each other. It's crazy how an extreme love for a certain person can drive you insane and even make you do unloveable things to them.\\nIn high school we used to spend almost everyday together and I loved it this changed after we went to college. When we graduated high school she went to Sweden for 7 weeks and we really started having a lot of relationship difficulties from there. I sort of started disconnecting and getting used to having more space. After she returned we noticed that we had both changed a lot and this led to a lot of fights but slowly but surely we kind of started having a healthy relationship. This took a lot of hard work, sacrifice and communication.\\nEverything changed when this happened however. Around the first year of the relationship we both promised each other to stop watching porn because it made us insecure. I did this for a long time but eventually relapsed around 8 times in the span of a year and never told her. She eventually had a suspicion and confronted me, I confessed and everything just went extremely downhill from there. She was really hurt and even more so about the fact that I hid it from her and was never planning on telling. We broke up after this but got back together after a couple weeks had gone by. Her trust however was never the same (and rightfully so).\\n# Her situation/depression\\nMy girlfriend originally started suffering from depression at 16 due to her birth control pills. I've been supporting her ever since. The first months it was really bad and she even tried taking her own life with sleeping pills she saved up. I called emergency services when this happened and she was taken to the hospital and given mental treatment after this all happened. There was a big problem however when she came home.\\nAfter hating me for a couple of days and wishing that I didn't call emergency services she finally told me the real reason why she wanted to die. It turns out that she was a gypsy, a Romani. And in their culture children have to be in arranged marriages at extremely young ages. Now its 16/18 but it used to be a lot younger. And it has to be with another gypsy otherwise the female is considered a whore and an outsider and is shunned by the entire family. I always thought that my girlfriend had strict parents but never to this extent I never asked any questions about why they couldn't know about us but now I knew.\\nShe always had a really good relationship with her mom but after the day she tried to commit suicide their relationship was strained for a very long time. Her mother (father is out of the picture) didn't believe in mental health and thought she was doing this to get attention which of course triggered my girlfriend even more. She also could never tell the full story to her mental health counselors because they would have to enable child protective services.\\nShe eventually made the choice to run away with me. But she seemed very conflicted about this and kind of flip flopped between staying with her mom and living for her and being with me. A lot of the times she did not want to make a choice because she felt she would be unhappy in both situations. A loveless (probably abusive) arranged marriage or an unstable relationship with me. She convinced herself dying was the best option eventually. I talked her out of it so many times and truly tried supporting her through everything. This took a large toll on me as she would often be really abusive.\\nEverything changed when I cheated however. She told me in the weeks that we broke up that I was the reason she was going to die and I was her only chance at a normal life. I tried to convince her otherwise but she just won't listen. After we got back together she told me she was going to die regardless of her relationship and she's just waiting for the right time. When I begged her not to she refused to change her choice and told me it was going to happen this year and I get to choose to be with her till the end or leave. When I asked why she said because I cheated and we would never be the same after this anyway.\\nI thought I could change her mind at first but I can't. I honestly don't know what to do anymore I see a future with this girl but she doesn't with me. I told her I'm going to think about my choice and she called me selfish. Supporting her through all of those years of this took a toll on my sanity,sleep and social life. I can't sit there and be with her until she dies. I don't understand how she wants to take me back after everything but doesn't want to run away with me anymore. I'm confused tired and stressed out. I've never talked about this with anyone and I just need to hear someone else's opinion on this.\\n# My final decision\\nI still havent decided what to do and told her I want to think about this long and hard. She told me I was selfish and compared me to the devil for leaving her with the depression and letting her die alone. I really need some advice.\\nI really don't want to be a temporary comfort for her I just can't. I love her to death and want to grow old with her and have a good relationship. I would permanently lose my sanity if I stayed I'm afraid but I also don't want to leave her like this.\\nI know a large part of our relationship troubles seem really immature and they are. But we were both really young and we still are and these are all just extremely hard choices to make at this age.\\nTL;DR: My girlfriend is going to kill herself and wants me to be with her till the end. I'm conflicted on what to do.\", 'text_b': None, 'label': 1}, {'guid': 2011, 'text_a': 'I need to take this off my chest or I fear the guilt is going to eat me alive : This is a long story but I will summarize it at my best.\\nI grew up with my mother. I stopped seeing my father reguarly at 5. He was not a good parent either way, it\\'s like he missed emotions or couldn\\'t show them, and in the last year I went from seeing him as a stranger to someone I actually hate because of the way he reacted after I came out. I can still recall him implying there\\'s something perverted in me.\\nMy mother is not that good either, despire being supportive of this, she was never uplifting in my childhood, rarely I was given support when I made errors, rather she would get mad and tell me often things were my fault. I was legit scared of her and felt like I had to walk on eggshells, because I knew she could snap for things as little as \"what hour is it?\". I don\\'t have many memories of my childhood, I forgot most of what happened and therefore it\\'s hard to tell how my parents were when I was a child, however I can still feel the effects on my mind. To this day, everytime someone is mad, even if not at me, in the same room as me, and the slightly raise their voice or become irritated, I can\\'t help but start panicking and shake.\\nBut in the end, except for my difficulty relationing to people and my fear of imminent abandonment and speaking up for myself, I never had severe problems.\\nI saw the first sign of something getting worst after I got dumped by my ex in november 2019. It was quick and unexpected, but I foresaw it, panicking the day before, fearing he would leave despite having no proof. It turned out my paranoia was right.\\nI quickly forgot about him (our relationship was long-distance and lasted only 1 month and a half) and started dating a friend\\'s friend, and he\\'s really someone I want in my life: he\\'s kind-hearted, creative, outgoing, funny, protective and ready to help with my mental illnesses. A human dog basically, and when I lay next to him or on his chest I feel a feeling of peace and happiness I hardly ever felt, but there\\'s flaws too, and that is he\\'s interested in open-relationships where I\\'m extremely monogamous. He made it clear that he thinks that consent is the most important thing and he wouldn\\'t force anyone in an open relationship, however, because of the fact that we are still dating he still talks to people online to roleplay sexual scenarios. This worries me more than it hurts, as I fear of losing him to someone else who might be better.\\nMy friends (who have knew him for years) reassure me he\\'s really into me and he himself told me he\\'s not romantically interested in anyone else, and that sex and love are separated to him, but I can\\'t stop feeling like I\\'m not good enough and I can be replaced any time. I know I have an obsessive and co-dependant type of love and once I find someone I really like I don\\'t want to let go and I feel like I\\'m dying without that person.\\nThis is just the tip of the iceberg however.\\nBoth me and him are very sexual people, but I have a very unhealthy view of sex: I have a very typical high male libido and I masturbate daily only to keep it down, but to do it I have to distract myself. If being scared of being touched because I\\'m extremely disgusted by my body wasn\\'t enough, I have to redirect my sexual fantasies to pleasing others, because, if I think about pleasing myself too, I will feel a terrible sense of guilt and shame from it that will break me in tears. I can\\'t help but feel like I\\'m not supposed to have sexual feelings, and that they make me dirty and perverted, that it\\'s wrong and I must feel ashamed of it and hide them.\\nI also have constant fanstasies about being in a relationship where I get beaten, pushed and yelled at to the point my mind breaks and I kill myself, or I straight up get beaten to death. When I talk about it people assume it\\'s some masochistic fantasy, however I derive zero pleasure from it, only pain. I can\\'t imagine myself being happy and loved because I feel like I don\\'t deserve it and that there\\'s something wrong with me that makes me unlovable.\\nI also fantasize about being violently raped, or to have sex when I don\\'t want to just to please my partner without him knowing. Another one is being mistreated during sex, not to feel pleasure, but as punishment for being dirty and disgusting by having sex.\\nI also started feeling suspicious of everyone after my breakup. I feel like I can\\'t trust anyone (friends included, not only romantic partners) and that they are all after me, wanting to hurt me, use me, and that I somehow deserve it because I\\'m \"bad and unpure\".\\nThis is killing me, and I can\\'t tell all of this to the guy I\\'m dating because I feel like a burden, but it still makes me feel like I don\\'t deserve him, or his affection. When I\\'m with him I forget everything and everyone, but the moment after he leaves I feel all the bad feelings back at it again, and I feel like I HAVE to run away or he, or someone else, is too going to hurt me.\\nSometimes all I can think about is cutting my wrists or throat open or banging my head against the wall or table to death. I fear of cutting myself too because if he sees it he\\'ll feel sad for me and I don\\'t want to put stress over him. Despite him being so, soo patient as a person, I still feel like everything might make him mad and make him leave me, or that if I say the wrong word when he\\'s angry at someone he\\'ll snap at me.\\nI\\'m extremely in love with him, but all this pain makes me feel like I should drop off because I\\'ll just become a burden on him, and that in the future he\\'ll just be with me because he feels pity for me not being able to go on alone due to depression, and that I\\'ll end up alone.\\nI just need to take this weight off my chest because I can\\'t bear it anymore.\\nThank you for anyone who has came so far.', 'text_b': None, 'label': 1}, {'guid': 2012, 'text_a': \"Extreme repulsion when people cares or shows me affection : I have no idea what's wrong with me.

I don't know if I need some advice or just to put this in writing so I can look at it in the form of words rather than manic anxiety and internal screaming. I suspect this is going to be really f\\\\*\\\\*\\\\*\\\\*\\\\*g long, so very sorry about that. Hope some of you stick with me to the end.\\nOk so context: I have a few mental health issues, most notably big time depression which has an organic cause. That means it doesn’t necessarily originate from any life event, and instead is an inescapable, life-long and not-very-treatable condition that results from my brain being wired like shit. Over the past 15 years or so (I’m 29) I’ve been steadily isolating myself and I never really learned how to form like personal connections beyond the shallowest kind (and those were mostly by proxy. Friends of friends, stuff like that). I did try to kill myself at one point, a few years ago, when I was at a specially low point. And it turns out I’m really bad at suicide, which is probably the only reason I haven’t tried again yet because if you try and fail to kill yourself there’s a lot of drama and it’s exhausting. And honestly I don't have the energy to try and make a life I'm content with, it just sounds too... too much.\\nAnd since then, well… I’d mostly accepted that being alive wasn’t something that I liked very much. I derive(d) very little pleasure from anything, endlessly tortured myself psychologically because when I felt bad at least I felt something, and didn’t have much of an interest in completing my education, finding a job, moving out of my parents’ home… Y’know, just generally having a life. I had sort of accepted, in a truly chill way, that I was merely existing between depressive episodes and that the next one very well could be the one to push me over the edge, so why bother? I was going to die, and honestly it was going to be soon, and there were means and there was planning. Most of the time, going through life without an escape plan (by which I mean suicide) was simply impossible. Like, I probably wouldn’t have lived to see August. I was considering my birthday, which on the one hand has the very nifty way of reducing peak grief days for my family and stuff, but on the other hand commiting suicide on your 30th birthday is just like ugh.\\nAND THEN, like a month ago, it just fucking went away. Like, I’m not FINE fine, but for the first time since I can remember I’m in a genuine, sort of stable good mood. I have energy, I am making some (SOME) good choices, I want to surround myself with people. For the first time in my life I’m thinking that maybe it would be nice to have a job, one that pays just well enough to move out and live with roomates or something. Learn how to deal with people, because currently I just don’t know how to people, and perhaps one day have a romantic relationship. Or several!\\nI’m not going to lie, I didn’t exactly welcome this change. I don’t know where it came from (I’ll get there sorry this is so long), or what to do with all that energy, or what I’m feeling most of the time because I have no context for any of this emotions. And a little later I just started to be terrified, all of the time, that one day it’s going to go away and never come back. I’m still terrified and confused and all that, but somehow it doesn’t detract from my good mood because now I’m a positive person I guess. Disgusting.\\nOKAY, that was context, so sorry for the rant. Here comes another one.\\nSo around the time this started, I was starting to hang out a bit more often with some friends of friends, always as a group. I like them very much, and I knew one of them beforehand. He’s really nice and the kind of person I would really like to hang out one-on-one (which we have, once, I think) if I knew how to like bond with people and talk to them just because, and if one-on-one weren’t such a terrifying thing. Kind of a mess, he is, but like in a sometimes endearing way. A bit sitcomy I guess. And while I honestly don’t know (because I don’t know anything anymore), I’m starting to fear that I might have a bit of a crush on him, which would be all-around terrible for several reasons.\\nFirst, feelings? Gross. I’ve rarely liked a guy. Hell, I haven’t ever kissed a boy I had feelings for. I’ve kissed many, fucked even more (rarely good, rarely worth it, always punishing), but never one I actually wanted to kiss. I don’t know if I know how to do that.\\nSecond, I’m happy but I’m not an idiot. If this is actually a crush, nothing good is ever going to come out of it. No way no how.\\nThird, timing. I was going to die, by my hand, soon, and now I have a new lease on life. Can you imagine that my sudden change is because I like a boy? It would be so sad, and really dangerous, and again so very sad. And I’m fine now, but what if I start wallowing about it? I can’t afford that.\\nSo I’ve come to the conclusion that me having a crush on this dude is:\\n* Really gross.\\n* Potentially lethal (for me).\\n* Ugh.\\nAnd like I said, I truly don’t think I’m in denial. I honestly don’t know and I’ve come (as I write this) to the very reasonable conclusion that the answer better be “no”. And I can’t tell, I really can’t tell. Yes, I feel sort of funky when I hear about his relationships and crushes and romantic connections, but honestly that doesn’t tell me much because I’ve always felt bad when hearing about blossoming new romances and shit, because it brings out many of my own insecurities.\\nI guess this is it? Oh, man.\\nTL;DR: I have depression, anxiety and a few other stuff going on, I don’t really have the energy or motivation to try to do anything about that, was planning to kill myself soon and then one day out of the blue I felt a lot better. Didn’t like it, didn’t understand it, live in fear it’s going to go away and never come back, now I don’t understand my own emotions most of the time. Because of timing I’m afraid I might possibly have a crush and that’s why I feel better, because that would suck real bad.\", 'text_b': None, 'label': 1}, {'guid': 2042, 'text_a': 'Overthinking... : I’m 18(m) but I’m always told I’m mature for my age.

However last night I was at a party and went back to a friends hosue afterwards with a few other people. There were 3 guys and 3 girls including me and so as teenagers normally would, we sort of paired up and each sat next to one of the girls.

I've been a huge fan of games and movies since I was a little child and yeah I usually got what I wanted but that's not the point here. When I was 5 or 6 years old my mother met her new man and they started dating and so on. Soon after they started to date he was all over me not like in sexual manner but he used to hit me and keep my head underwater and lock me in sauna and even kept me from eating sometimes. And he always did these things when I did something that he thought was wrong like not  cleaning up my room, being late or if I didn't do any homeworks. And he even did it in front of my mom sometimes and she did nothing to prevent it they even had a kid and got married. Of course when my step brother was born i got blame for every little mistake that I made and If my brother fell over then I got the blame and I was hit by my stepfather. Only one who believed me when I told about this was my dad's aunt who was my best friend and who always had my back but she was really old like 80 but she was everything to me back then because I didn't have any friends and I have always been that lonely kid.\\nWhen I grew up my dad's aunt died and soon after my grandmother and those two were really important to me and I didn't even cry when they died because all that I felt was deep emptiness that I still feel to this day even though I don't want to admit it. It left a deep void in me that I have tried to fill up for years and sometimes it has worked and I have felt happy but soon after it has only gone downhill. After my ''real'' first relationship in 9th grade ended when she cheated on me and went with another one and soon after that I have always felt really not so good about myself and I even thought about killing myself because life just felt so worthless but then came this another girl who first understood me and tried to help me and she did for a while and so we ended up talking for many months before we started to date and that was the worst relationship that I had ever had because it involved a lot of arguments and she blamed me about everything and I reacted the wrong way and I cheated on her and it left me with so much guilt that after few months it told her about it and I wanted to break up and so after that I avoided relationships and pretty much any human contact for 6 months until a new girl came into my life and we dated for few months and we broke up because I was a real mess and after few months we decided to try again and everything was going on really good until my mental issues surfaced and they pretty much messed up everything.\\nWell few months I was diagnosed with depression and OCD and I sometimes i get these intrusive thoughts that makes me question everything in my life but mostly it focuses on my relationship. Like those thoughts range from ''You don't feel for her anymore'', ''You don't love her anymore'' to ''just end this relationship'' and it makes me question that do I have feelings for her still. Sometimes I get this feeling of deep emptiness and sometimes it comes when I am alone and when I am with her and it scares the hell out of me. Like I want to enjoy my life with her but my mind struggles so hard to make me feel like that I don't want to be with her anymore and sometimes it feels so real that I even start to believe it. I have told her about these and she has promised to help me in anyway that she can so she is very understanding. This is also concerning to me because we haven't had any problems in our relationship and soon we have dated for a year. She was my ex before but we broke up because I was acting like an asshole and she still had feelings towards her ex so we broke up but then I didn't know about it even though I asked her many times. And when we got back together she didn't tell me about it and I had to find out myself and I felt really bad because she lied to me back then but now everything has been fine in our relationship and we have both worked on those old issues and are no longer keeping secrets but I can't find out why I feel like this.

My mother and I always had a great relationship (as great as it can get hen you are only discussing school and leaving out every personal feeling and thought because you know your mom will never understand). It was obvious that I was their favorite; I was spoiled rotten. My relationship with my dad was loving and nice, but we never really talked. There was no depth. However, it was not like that with my mom. We talked about school and my friends, but I never felt comfortable talking about my personal life with her because she was incredibly judgmental. I kept a lot of things to myself, or I would share them with my sister. She is my best friend, and has always been kind of a second mom to me, something my mother was always jealous of. In all honesty, I, and much of my family members believe my mother has a mental illness (my sister and I have diagnosed her with being a sociopath after a lot of research and reminiscing), however she refuses to acknowledge it. All in all, my life was not perfect, but it was a good life filled with family and friends.\\xa0\\nI met my best friend in 6th grade, but we did not become true best friends until high school. We were inseparable; I was either at her house, or she at mine. We told each other everything, as best friends do. We even had similarly strict mothers, so we could relate to each other in that aspect. We always talked about living together when we went off to college, to get an apartment together to have our freedom, but we knew our mothers would never approve. So we planned in secret.\\nAs I said, my mother and I had a good relationship. I was always a good child. I was terrified of getting in trouble, and never disobeyed my parents. It was not until my senior year of high school that I could see our relationship changing for the worse. My mother became even more strict, nosey, and suspicious. I wanted my freedom, and she wanted nothing more than to keep me locked in our house with as little freedom as possible. The last thing she ever wanted was for me to have my own life and leave her and my dad. Needless to say, the older I got, the harder it was to live in that house.\\nIn 2011, I graduated from high school and began going to a community college in town, where I stayed for one year to start my basics. During this time, living at home was a nightmare. I was 19 and still had to ask permission to do anything and everything. I was miserable. Meanwhile, my bff and many of my other friends went straight to universities. I was young, impatient, and wanted to be like everyone else, so I transferred to the university in my town that next fall. My dad worked there at the time, so I got a huge discount on tuition as long as I maintained a certain GPA. As I have said, my mother is crazy and strict. Once I was attending, my mother was always in my school business. For some reason, she was under the impression that I had to show her my grades daily. She did not understand that college was not high school; we do not receive report cards, and my grades were just that—MY grades. I felt no obligation to show her or anyone else how I was doing in school. In all honesty, I was doing very poorly. I was not adjusting well to college and it showed in my grades. I was never one to disappoint my parents. I always tried my best in school and made decent grades, so this was all completely new to me. So, when my mom was constantly asking to see my grades and I refused, conflicts arose.\\xa0\\nLiving at home was harder than ever. I was trying to grow up and become my own person, while my mother was trying to keep me her baby for as long as she could; except she did it in the only way she knew how, which was to pick fights and push me away. We fought constantly about everything. She tried to take away my phone at times, but I paid for my phone bill so I refused. She went ballistic. Refusing to show her my grades set her off. She even wanted to know my login information, which I did not give to her and she hated it. I could not talk to my dad about any of this, because he always sided with my mom, or would just defend her. He never saw her in the same light as my siblings and I did--fearful, crazy, unstable, and unpredictable.\\nI was 20 by now, and finishing up my first semester at college. My grades were the worst I’ve ever had, and I knew my mom would be upset. Bff and I had been planning to move out together soon, except neither of us told our parents. I knew the conversation with my mom would not be civil, and bff's mom would just try to talk her out of it. My mom has a history of getting violent, both verbally, mentally, and physically. This is one of the reasons I tried to never disappoint or anger her. She never laid a finger on me (aside from spankings when I was younger), and in my mind I would never let her. I would never put up with abuse as she did to both my siblings. I had seen first hand what she was capable of, and that scared me. So, I came up with the best solution I could think of to protect myself.\\xa0\\nIt was now the end of the semester, and grades were posted. I was ashamed of how terrible I did and I knew my mom would want to see them when she got home. So, I packed a bag and I told my dad I was going out, and left. Before getting even a mile down the road my mom called me. She knew something was up—call it mother's intuition. I told her that I was leaving, that I could not do it anymore, and that I was sorry. She completely lost her mind, which I expected. In my mind I had two options; stay and tell her in person and risk getting hit (the risk was a 100% possibility), or do as I did. Eventually I got to my destination, a friend’s house, and I explained everything. I called my sister and told her everything, and unfortunately put her in the middle of it all. My mom was desperate to get me to come home, so eventually I agreed to meet her at my friends house. Before my friend got a chance to tell her mom our plan of moving out, my mom beat her to it and told her everything. This complicated everything more. We met at her house, and I was terrified of seeing my mom. I knew what was coming. Sure enough, when I denied going back home, she tried to hit me and shoved me into a bookshelf. I threatened to call the cops, and friends mom asked her to leave. In return she took my car and left me there. Everyone was in shock; there were no words to describe how we each felt. I eventually called my sister and she came to pick me up and took me home with her. That night was one of the longest of my life. I broke my parent’s heart, and they broke mine. That one decision, forever changed my life.\\xa0\\nMy friend and I were still in touch to move in together, however it was not for a month or so. For the next few months, I was considered homeless. I stayed with my sister, a friend I met at college, and a coworker from when I worked at Walmart. During all this time I only had the bag of stuff I took with me the night I left home. My mom refused to let me get my stuff, and in all honesty, I was terrified to go back and get it. During this time, I met my boyfriend. We were coworkers at Walmart, and he invited me to stay with him and his roommates during the holidays, which I accepted. We clicked and decided that when I moved into my apartment with my friend, he would move in too and help with the rent.\\xa0\\nOne day, bff and I were finally able to sign for a 6 month lease on a 2 bedroom apartment. The day came when we could finally move in, which my bf and I did. Neither of us had many belongings. He came from the dorms at college, and I came with my bag. I kept asking my friend when she was bringing her stuff, so she would bring little things over, like dishes or other impersonal items. I began getting the feeling that she was hiding something from me. Sure enough, I was right. One day, she texted me and told me how sorry she was, but that she would not be moving in with me and would continue to pay her half of the rent. Not only had I lost my relationship with my parents just months before, but I also lost my best friend. I was so upset at her for doing that to me, betraying me, and not even having the nerve to tell me in person but over a text. At this point the only people I had in my life was my sister, and my bf. My life kind of sucked.\\xa0\\nFor the next few years, my mom called me constantly, leaving me ugly voicemails, calling me every name in the book, and completely disowning me. My dad was hardly aware of the situation, and kept his distance; he never even reached out to me. In addition to disowning me, my mom also disowned my sister and her two kids, because she thought my sister helped me plan my moving out. To this day, my mom has never tried to make contact with my sister or her kids. In fact, those kids are terrified of her and hate her because of what she did to my sister and me.\\xa0my niece, who is know 13 actually has nightmares about my mom. \\nAbout 4-and-a-half years ago, my mom let my dad bring me my stuff. It was a truckload of my belongings, half of which she destroyed. I remember going through it with my sister, we pulled out a blanket that smelled like a combination of vomit and urine. I had to throw it out, as well as other items that were crushed or vandalized. I never got all of my stuff back, and I probably never will. I had never stepped foot in that house again until last year when I went to visit my dad. My mom was not home so I knew it was safe. We talked outside for a bit, and I asked to go inside. I wanted to see my old room. There were still some of my things in the closet and room, like my rock collection. I asked my dad if I could take it with me but he said no, because then my mother would know I was there and he wouldn’t want to upset her. I walked around the rest of the house, everything was the same as the last time I was there; they even still had our pictures up—which I thought was ridiculous. All of my old toys from when I was a child were packed away somewhere. My dad said maybe one day I can have them. I hope one day I can, because it stinks not having one thing from my childhood to see or hold, or give to my future kids.\\xa0\\nIt has been about 7 years now since everything happened, and I still cry for the relationship I will never have with my parents. I cry that I will never feel the embrace of my mom or dad again; that I will never hear them tell me “I love you” ever again; that they will never know their future grandchildren or son in law. It hurts me so deeply, but I know that nothing will ever be the same. I truly believe that my mom has an illness, and even if she were to seek out help, I would never be able to talk to her the way I used to again. I envy the people who have amazing parents, who love them unconditionally, the way a parent is supposed to love their child. I question everyday why I was not blessed with parents like that. Every time something bad happens in my life, I question if it is my karma for leaving the way I did and if that is what I deserve for hurting my parents. I cannot begin to imagine the pain and hurt I put my mother and father through, but I don’t think that is an excuse for their behavior or the way they treated my sister and I. I have spent many days and nights crying for that loss, and I hope that one day I can truly move past this, and be happy the way I once was knew how to be.\\xa0\", 'text_b': None, 'label': 1}, {'guid': 2052, 'text_a': \"Deciding about my future is so fucking difficult : I should chose a university I want to study at and apply there in 2 months.

I had Images from that time that ive builded as Example two towers connected by another and i also builded around that time out of lego complex stuff and i liked to help others, also the only other thing i remember was that ive had in a game 4 times a 6. Then i was going to an special school wich started with an 0th class (yep i know it sounds like bs but its not... actually its not lied but its bs) It was a smaller school wich i had an unbeliveable nice teacher, she even allowed us to ride once on her parents horses. Then our class had split up bec we were too less and a while after i was in the new class i switched to an normal school, i cant tell when exactly or why the school got closed some years later since it would give hints instandly to me. in the new school i was in a relation ship with a girl slided her pants down the list time we saw us, i know thesedays its thinking over sexualized but back in the time it was just doctorgames or something like that, also i tell it here since it will be relevant later on. In the new school i had 3 female friends, i often did hurt them at games like hidenseek but didnt understand that i did that, i was still lacking emphaty, they all remember me as an idiot, the teachers said i should think about my actions but i didnt know what thinking was. (also i should mention that it was like ive skipped a class since as example what we would do in the 3th class they do in the 2th, one more information is that i never learned the Abc or this other form of writing.)  \\nIn that time i had doctorgames with another girl but without touching, the next day she talked about everyone about it)  \\nAnd while that time i watched sience shows for 2 years, in that time i had my first depression since i started to think and to understood that our lifes are useless, i was also scared of the power of nature. Im not sure if it was here that my mom had a shop in another country with my aunt. i drove like every weekend and holiday for 2 years  there, on the way i first time learned to controll what i see, in your words imanigation, from that point on i done it like extremly often. around that time when i was out i had my first friend outside of the school, we were often in the forest doing shit, with my belgium cousin we played minecraft on a virus flooded laptop from me and yea life was simple for me.  \\nITS TIME TO LET THE SHIT GO DOWN\\nonce a battle over money came up and we litterally fleed with an other cousin wich lived at my aunt out of the country, we did hide our car somewhere and he broke multible windows and raced in a 50 zone with 130 and lost after that they his license for a while, we escaped to our home country. then my mom opened her own buisness. meanwhile i came in the 5th grade and had fun batteling with 11th graders in sience and i also learned that my brain is slowly advancing stupidly fast, a teacher gave me a long mathematic x=... and he just gave me one precalculated one, i remember that i didnt know what ( etc means but after 30min watching it i learned to calculate such equaltion , also in my head i could controll my dreams, i builded up a futurist world where everything is fine and the technologys i created over time in my head are real machines wich are innovative.) i didnt make really friends at that time, it didnt bother me. in 6/7th grade i had a social teacher helping me since i saw her as a mother at that time my head started to let me see memories like a video, my brain adapted to an pc analysing like vision, my math grades exploded, also i kept rooms i was in in my head and on the floor when light was off i could overdraw what i see with red lines and also i could manipulate my own memories (wich fucked me since im not sure if anything i tell here isnt a fucking manipulation) in that time i was often in illegal streams too to watch anime, once i got interested and just pressed on a ad with flat boobs, i keep doing that until i came to a page with pornhub at start and a link going my entire screen, it was my first contact with cp. To this day im sure that some people from pornhub host in normal net childporn but just hide it extremly well. Also WTF can a little kid find cp but not some fucking paid police officers.... Then it interested me, i didnt get hard or something, it was just sheer the new wich dragged me to get tor and seach stuff up and i did find it and i watched it a whole year, i wanted to know why people do such things and so on, it just interested me their motives, i know its terrible and im preparing already for the negative karma flood but yea, (watched reddit videos). then i skipped a class again. in my new class my grades exploded in the prositiv and i met a girl, the girl teached me emotions over time, in winter also i had a relation started with a girl wich i played often and we videochatted alot, she was a year younger then me, you need to know that i was fat at that time and some people really though im old, even tho i wasnt even 15... her brother forced us to stop contact. after that i was down and really sad. at that spring my head started to hurt a bit always and slowly i my ability to remember stuff got bad, when i overjumped i knew wich cloth everyone had to any day, i could give exact dialogs some days after so on. at that time i stopped the relation with my best and first real friend i had since he emotionally abused me. my parents splitted also up a year before and my mom moved to another man and left me and my brother together at a home, i was the one who said yes but yea, i also saw all the abuse from my parents aganist each other... even the blood on the floor. but back in the time now i also slept like 2-4 hrs everyday... i also stopped really learning new things ( men while i type this down i stopped and started alot of shit lol) she also teached me how to talk normal and not just in complicated words, funny thing is i can now just talk so and not complicated. i also took an iq test wich revealed that im very close to autism, my brain structure is different and the test were made in 4 catergory's, in one i had 78 point and in the highest i had 138, the docs told me they never seen such an difference, the highest they even knew before was 24. wich is extrem already, over years my grades got worse, my meorie system is fucked now, i can remembler like almost nothing, i cant learn anymore, i had 2 breakdowns, i figured out that my family dont cares about me, my brother emotionally abuses me, i cant learn anymore and i feel degenerating. i lost my vision my dream world wich always protected me, i have now friends and emphaty but the question is what do i do now?  \\nIm stuck, i want out of this life, i wanna develope the technologys in my head but how when noone belives me, i could have a trauma from the forced end relation from the other shit or from the time where an another aunt used a hammer to attack us with the aunt before to get somehow money, i stopped to belive in god a long time ago, im just lost, i want my memories back my old abilitys, i wanna find a way how to get out of this shit, i know i missed alot of informations but does anyone know what i have to do, i tried to give an text about whats wrong with me but im just not fine anymore. please help me, im lost my memories are gone im degenerating my mental health getting abused my family doesnt care about me.

You read my title. I mean come on now. Isnt \"My Addiction to Pain\" a good ass tittle? DOES THAT NOT GRAB YOUR ATTENTION? Sorry sorry. I get carried away sometimes.

Hence the whole \"My\" in the title. This is a story of my struggles in life and what I had to overcome and what almost made me take my own life. This is the story of a man who has known nothing but pain for such a long time that he realized it was the only thing constant in his life. The only thing he knew to be true. He knew this feeling so well he fell in love with it. He fell in love with a feeling of dread, quilt, and despair. He fell head over heels for it and he didn\\'t even know it.

My last relationship was way over before I even knew it. I was with this girl for quite some time and I didnt even know our relationship had already ended. What do I mean by that? Well, she and i were at a rough spot for a while. Constantly fighting constantly arguing over stupid things. But me being the idiot I was, I thought that was normal. You know?\\xa0 Like every relationship they show on TV or have people tell you, you\\'ll always argue with the significant other. That\\'s just life. That\\'s \"NORMAL\". But I was a fool when it came to this. I didnt know she and I had already drew our last breath in this relationship. I didnt know she had already moved on and found someone else. I dont blame her. I really dont. She and I had been in a tight spot for a while. Where she and I would argue almost every night over such stupid little things.\\xa0\\nIt\\'s funny to be honest. Looking back now. Those fights are kinda what I miss most now. Because with every compromise she and I made I knew she cared. Even if it was a little bit. Maybe I should have been more supportive on her endeavors. Maybe I should have been there for her. Maybe I should have continued to monitor the situation and adapt to her to keep her. These are the thoughts that keep up at night. These are the reasons why I dont sleep. Because I think about her every night. Right now it is March 8th 2020. We broke up on November 18th. On her birthday when I went to go and see her. Yet I lie here awake at night not able to sleep thinking about what we could have been doing right now. What we could have been talking about. What we could have been planning. Not a day has gone by where I haven\\'t thought about her…\\xa0\\nI promise you reader this has never ever been me. I was never one to be like this. Sure I\\'ve always been lonely. I\\'ve actually always liked being alone. To be in my own bubble. Away from society and family. Just on my own. But nowadays… while I still crave to be alone in my thoughts I get upset because I know theres no one thinking of me. I know that at night I wont be able to sleep with someone on the phone or have a night call with. You may be telling yourself \"well why dont you find someone else to do all those things with?\". It\\'s just not that simple. I got torn down when she and I broke up. I became someone I didnt even recognize anymore. When I look in the mirror I don\\'t even see myself anymore. I see a lost soul looking for something that is out of my grasp out of my understanding. Out of my comprehension of what I am feeling right now. Have you ever felt this pain? This suffering that all you want to do is get better but cant? That when you see a happy couple you cant help but imagine but to remember that\\'s how you used to feel like?

The theories presented are of my own creation and have not been tested in any way. \\nAs an individual struggling with depression, the search for happiness has gone hand in hand with a search for survival. Strugglers of serious depression spend their whole lives in search of happiness. Depression is a journey for happiness, unique to each individual. One main misconception about \"curing\" depression is that other people know how to guide you on your journey. Happiness doesn\\'t have a formula. Any doctor that claims to have a method for curing depression is a waste of your time.   \\nMany non depressed people hold individuals to societal standards and if individuals meet these standards and are depressed, people look at them and wonder why. I\\'m not an exception. I attend a prestigious university, am very financially support by very well off parent, have never had to worry about any basic human needs, have tons of friends, a girlfriend, and I\\'m doing well in school. But I also sat on my be also nightly with a knife to my wrist edging ever so close to choosing the easy way out. I cry myself to sleep every night out of self loathing and when I wake up, my first thought of the day is is this going to be my last day? \\nNaturally, given my well off parents, I received every treatment / therapy you could imagine in my quest to shake my depression. None of it had any effect. I continued down the path of following recommendations and such on the internet and from professionals; that path drove me deeper and deeper into depression. My depression got to the point where I wasn\\'t even sure if I liked my intermediate family anymore. One day, I snapped. I just left. Not for long, only about 6 hours, but in those 6 hours, I learned more about the way life works than I had in my previous 20 years.\\nIn those 6 hours I learned the most crucial lesson anyone could teach you: you know what\\'s best for you and you alone can best medicate your mind. When it comes to your physical health, it is best to leave it to the professionals. This is because anatomically, most bodies are the same. They are made up of the same stuff and operate virtually the same way regardless of the human. But this is the exact opposite for the brain. \\nEvery brain on planet earth is distinct and unique. I would describe the brain using the 90/10 theory. 90% of the human brain is a result of evolution. We all have the same survival instincts and similar traits that have resulted in humans arriving where they are today. This area of the brain allows us to converse, eat, sleep, and do everything \"normal humans\" do. Your 90% is what makes you human. However, it is the 10% of the brain where you find uniqueness among individuals. Your 10% is who you are, what separates you from other humans. Ideally, individuals will let their 10% loose and really express who they are. This is unfortunately very far from reality. As I have pointed out and will continue to, society isn\\'t good for the individual. Society is a competition for materialistic things in order to prove you are \"better\" than someone. Due to the competitive side that exists in the 90%, societal expectations take control over your 10%, hindering you from truly being you. More on the process of taking control of your 10% below.\\nI\\'m still developing my craft as a writer and couldn\\'t find a great way to transition to this paragraph, so here\\'s a really awkward and out of place sentence. Social classes have certain expectations within that class and you are considered a failure in some respects if you don\\'t meet these expectations. For the son of an upper class white male such as myself, the expectations look somewhat like this: go to college, graduate, get a job, make money, get married, have kids, retire early because you are wealthy. It didn\\'t occur to me until my sophomore year (I had been dealing with depression for multiple years at this point) of college \"what if I don\\'t want to meet these expectations?\" \\nFor some this is going to be a lot harder than for others. Accepting that you no longer want to fit into these societal expectations will often be met with judgment and criticism from the people you thought were your closest friends, sometimes even family. I understand more than most just trying to fit in in order to feel good about yourself, but I promise you that once you pursue what you are genuinely passionate and excited about, you won\\'t care about other peoples opinions of you. The people who truly care about you will stay by your side regardless of how you live your life.  \\nIt is my belief that depression is somewhat systematic, meaning the society we live in promotes unhealthy standards of living leading to an increase in depression in younger people. Take the risk to be your own person. Own your 10%.  \\nThe 3 big takeaways\\n* \"Good\" \"Happy\" \"Happiness\" are all relative terms. Just because something makes you happy, doesn\\'t mean it will make someone else happy.\\n* This one is more directed at parents. I understand that if the child is younger it is your responsibility to raise your kid as you see fit (I am not a parent and am in no way trying to give parenting advise). That being said, once your kid reaches around college age, as I have, they\\'re old enough to start formulating their own decisions. If your child has been depressed over the past couple of years and you play a big role in their life, as hard as it is to do, you need to step back and allow your kid to pursue what he/she wants to pursue, not what you want him/her to pursue or what you think he/she should pursue. I\\'m not saying step completely out of his/her life, but as your child matures, it is important to take more of an advisor type role. As tough as it might be to watch your kid fail, we need to learn from our mistakes and learn from them.\\n* You know what\\'s best for you. Don\\'t be afraid to pursue what you love to do. Own your 10%.\\nAgain, this letter is from personal experience and everything said does not necessarily apply to everyone, or anyone for that matter.

And I know there are worse things that people are going through especially right now but I don't need that pointed out to me. \\nI guess I'll start with some backstory. \\nI'm 26, Irish, female, bartender, writer, sister, daughter, auntie, friend. Yesterday, my bar announced that it was closing for the next 'week' and the Taoiseach hasn't officially put us into lockdown yet but we will be by Tuesday apparently. Social gatherings were banned, public places were told to close and we're all obviously being told to stay the fuck indoors.\\nNot only am I worried about the fact that a pandemic the likes of which has never been seen in history is encapsulating the entire planet, or for the safety of my loved ones, friends and colleagues or the fact that I now have no job, no savings and no way to pay rent on the first, the thing that I am most afraid of losing is my sanity. \\nI grew up in an extremely difficult household, my parents were verbally, emotionally and physically abusive. My dad was only ever there to hurt us or shout at us and my mother is an alcoholic. My older sister left the second she could and my older brother withdrew to avoid them so I was left to raise my little sister as best I could. \\nI've had depression for as long as I can remember. I was diagnosed after an overdose at 15 and psychiatrists have always told me that it seems I had depression since I was a young girl. I didn't even know that was possible. It's eaten every inch of my mind, my body and my life. \\nIt affects every single tiny little thing that I do - good or bad. I have trust issues, abandonment issues, self hatred, an eating disorder and a very bleak outlook on life in general. Or I should say I did. \\nLast year was the worst year of my life by far, it all just seemed to come to a head and I grew so frustrated with it that a miracle happened. I had to do something to change it. \\nOkay no, not a miracle. I've been in and out of therapy since I was 15 and I've been on antidepressants on and off the whole time too. Four years ago, I found my therapist Amy and it changed my life. I've been seeing her at least once a week since and I've been back on meds for the last three or so years too. I've made so much progress and worked so hard and gotten so far that this year, I felt happy and settled enough to come off my medication and even take a break from therapy! \\nAnd I've been doing great! I'm literally a new person, if it comes up in conversation with people that I have met this year, they are shocked at my background and history with mental illness! It's incredible. \\nDon't get me wrong. I have bad days and weeks still. The darkness is still and will always be there. It just so happens that for the first time in my life, there's light too! \\nSorry if this is too much, I just need to vent and I don't think I can even call Amy in the midst of this. \\nSo we come to yesterday. I usually live in the city with a couple that I'm not close with at all but they're not bad people, we just don't vibe. I was planning on staying with my parents this weekend anyway so I came after work on Friday. I had a good day yesterday, playing with my nephew and catching up with my family - we have a very strained relationship now and it's in no way healthy but to me, it's better than nothing and my two year old nephew is reason enough to try to build a relationship with them and he's the main reason I visit every few weeks. \\nI'm sorry, I'll get to the point. \\nMy family say I should stay here while this all tides over but being in this house where my heartbreaking childhood happened is always difficult for more than a couple days. With our strained relationship, I spend a lot of time here alone to avoid them and when we are together, it's often at odds. I can still exercise here, I'll probably be able to see friends and it'll be easier to see the guy I'm seeing if we can at all. \\nMy other option is to go back to my apartment in the city where I will be stuck with my housemates, which I also find very socially awkward and I'd probably spend the whole time in my room or on the balcony, alone. I don't know if I'll be allowed out of the apartment to exercise if lockdown comes and there's no space at all to exercise inside. It will be very unlikely to see friends there too. \\nEveryone is delighted with two/four weeks to sit at home getting fat and watching TV but me? It's my worst nightmare. I usually work 60+ hours a week, go to the gym four days a week and meet friends every single day. I stay out of the house as much as I possibly can because even though I enjoy spending 2/3 hours every day on my own smoking and watching YouTube or writing, I can't spend long periods of time at home or alone. \\nI'm afraid I'll be a shell of a human being either way at the end of the month and it hurts so much to know I'll have to backtrack on a lot of the work I've done already. \\nI hate this, I hate all of it and I'm sorry to be complaining about something that seems insignificant compared to everything that is happening but my mind is the only thing I have ever had and my happiness is something I worked very long and hard for - and I simply can't lose it.\", 'text_b': None, 'label': 0}, {'guid': 2880, 'text_a': 'Dreams suck : I hate it when it happens.

While away(7+ years), I took meds, went to a counselor and volunteered with animals when I knew I was coming down with an episode. Some days were worst than others but for the most part, I sort of had it handled. Now, I have NOTHING that I had. Most days are bad. \\nThere’s family that’s come from out of town. Honestly, I’m just not in a social mood. My grandparents told them I was in the room so they knocked. I went out to speak and came back in the room.

disorder doesn\\'t make sense to me, other personal thoughts / experiences i have, etc : for example, how is one supposed to differentiate \"episodes\" of mania / hypomania states from depressive states as a distinct problem vs having highs and lows caused by other things such as ritualistic coping mechanisms that influence personality? like if the way someone functions is relatively stable, hence in relation to having a \"personality disorder\", then how is one supposed to make a qualitative distinction between how someone with bipolar disorder should behave like / think like / function like who doesn\\'t have a personality disorder vs someone who doesn\\'t have bipolar disorder but does have a Personality vs someone who has both ( let\\'s just say ). \\nas someone who ISN\\'T diagnosed with bipolar disorder of any type ( instead have schizotypal personality disorder and major depression), but whom has met and been around many people who have had it for many years, probably the majority of them being the case in mental health groups, what i never seem to understand is this whole state dependent thing. like you either randomly become manic / hypomanic or you become \"Depressed\". it\\'s as if environmental issues / other factors don\\'t play a significant role or don\\'t need to at all, and it\\'s simply a come and go thing that\\'s 100 percent biological. it\\'s often very evident in the way they talk, like when i am in a depressive \"State\", it\\'s difficult to do things, and if i\\'m in a manic state, we\\'ll i\\'m doing things in stereotypical manners...\\nand a lot of people could say, we\\'ll, it\\'s like the whole spectrum way of looking at things, and that it only becomes a disorder if there is enough symptoms or impairment to start being considered one, but that\\'s a problem, because it doesn\\'t look at WHY the person is the way they are and it\\'s assuming that what the person is expressing or functioning like is the same thing as another. \\noften when i\\'d go to the DBSA groups, they\\'d use a scale, and eventually i became tired of giving a number, because neither numbers would fit my types of problems. if i said i was a low enough number, it would suggest that i should be in the hospital ( i had to clarify a more specific number to indicate what would be more \"Realistic\" when really the bipolar scale just wasn\\'t applicable to me ), and if i suggested something in the high range, it would suggest that i am manic or have some form of mania, when it\\'s not. so much an issue, that i\\'d be concerned about other people suggesting me to go take of my mental health first, because they\\'re too dumb to realize anything more complex. for example, agitation / anxiety / irritability / or restlesness would be considered as leaning towards mania, yet when you look at many research, it shows that those with unipolar depression can have all these issues, but that doesn\\'t make them have any sort of bipolar disorder...., you know, agitated depression would be an example. \\nnow this is just my personal observation / opinion, but i feel like bipolar disorder is a combination of biological and personality caused condition, where it can only occur in certain people with certain personality / psychological traits and biological influences. the reason why i say this is because pretty much everyone i\\'d meet or seen, as well as what research has shown about these individuals, as well as observing the nature of the condition itself, has shown that the type of problem in bipolar disorder is more specific to certain types of people with certain types of genes. and so what i\\'m trying to say is that it wouldn\\'t be correct or logical to just say that everyone can develop disorder, regardless of personality and genetic associations, and neither would it make sense for many other disorders. \\nand so it\\'s really irritating when people just wan\\'t to generalize or give a statement such as we\\'ll, just because your experience was like that, doesn\\'t mean it can\\'t be like this. like they aren\\'t actually factoring in what i said and coming up with an explanation that could provide some kind of reasoning that would answer my question in a more careful conscientious manner. \\nlike you could say, hmm..., that\\'s a good point, i\\'m not sure, i guess it could be like this or that..., \\nbut the thing is, from all these bipolar people i met and talked to, both in person and online, it was not like that at all, and that was with most of them being medicated too...., \\nand i never found someone who was different than the big 5 research either or MBTI faceats in relation to bipolar related disorders, including schizoaffective disorder bipolar type. all of them were either N\\'s / Ps and / or low on conscientiousness + high openness to experience, either low or high on agreeableness, low or high on extroversion, ( high on \"neuroticism\" ).  \\nalso as a random inference, what i noticed is that borderline PD co-occurred in a large proportion of these bipolar disordered people, and i didn\\'t find that surprising because the same has been shown in other \"Research\", and many of these people, if not majority of them i should say benefit well from the same types of treatments of \"typical\" people. like if they were qualitatively differently functioning people that much, they wouldn\\'t be benefiting so well or have such good outcome, particularly in the same domains of \"typical\" people, yet they do and my experiences with them were more or less similar. their personalities although not all the same were more alike than different. \\ni use to think i had borderline PD before i was diagnosed with schizotypal PD, until i realized i\\'m not like those who actually are diagnosed with borderline PD at all, and i don\\'t even wan\\'t to associate myself with them either. but then again, i don\\'t relate to the majority of people with schizotypal PD either, so much that i don\\'t think i even have schizotypal PD. it seems like the only logical solution would be Personality disorder NOS, but who\\'s gonna get support for that? \\ni have tried raising similar questions and viewpoints in various threads, reddit, psychforums, mentalhealthforums, and other places, but i just don\\'t have anyone else who shares the same experiences as me or thinks / functions the same way, and even if they do, we\\'ll they unfortunately suffer more \"silently\" and are not as visibly discernible, but i know that wouldn\\'t be true, because if they really were like me, i\\'d bump into more of them making the same types of points. you know, i rarely give casual generalized responses. my hope is to find a personality disorder support group in person that isn\\'t focused on borderline PD, since the only ones out there largely focus on those who have Borderline PD, which again, i see them closer to those with bipolar disorder than those with actual personality disorders...., but i guess my definition is a bit broad. i will say that i never met someone who had vulnerable narcissism or paranoid PD. i mean,  tons of people with paranoid schizophrenia but disorders that had paranoia in terms of relating to their personality, nada...., and even if i did, they weren\\'t like me, and their paranoia was more or less

At this point I just go through the motions replicating what I remember passion and energy felt like, while apathy eats away at whatever I have left.  My friends are to busy with there lives for me to bother them with my issues.  My family has never cared about my issues, and would prefer to pretend they and I don't exist.  Work is the same as you can imagine in the USA, you're a cog they use till they see its breaking and then they throw it away.  I don't want to harm myself and am not considering suicide, nor do I think I ever will again.  But I  can't do anything except invision this person I want to be and wish I was, everday knowing I'm not that person and seeing how unlikely it is I'll ever be that person.  I feel like I've become a void and now I'm consuming myself, and I don't have the energy or the knowledge to stop it.  It doesn't help that I got depressing news today.

This is my first real post on reddit. I had depression when I was younger. Under 10 I’m unsure of what age I was. Fast forward to 2016 I met this girl let’s call this person Beth. and my whole world changed. We had to secretly date cause her mother hated my guts. Some bipolar thing. I’m not sure. Anyway we were together and I kissed her and we were each other’s first. All the things. She moved up to New York to get away from her mom. She left a few days after my birthday. May 1st. I went and visited her a few times. I went in October then March then she came in may for my birthday. A failed surprise attempt. I’m always on top of the small clues. She went back a week later. She drove down for the summer like 18 hours of driving. I’m from Mississippi so it’s a fair distance. She came down, and it was clear she was not going back. We got engaged lives together had dogs, horses, chickens, cats, snakes, gerbils. All sorts of animals. We had a falling out one day and it all went down from there. She called my dad abusive all the time. She never met him, and was just going off what my mom said. That killed me inside because my dad died of a heart attack and the dog at the house ate part of his face off. So you can imagine how that made me feel. We had fights. We would get physical. I would try to calm things down and she would always jab at my dad which set me off. Let’s just say I didn’t take well to it. I always tried to make it up. We would bite, and punch. I wouldn’t hit her as hard as she hit me. I know I shouldn’t have anyway. I was filled with anger. I told her all my triggers and weaknesses. She used them against me constantly. We were in school for 2 year degrees. This last December she got her degree. She crashed her car so I had to get up early to take her to class. (She had earlier classes then me) no problem I did it without a second thought. After that we were getting evicted (we had till June to get our affairs set in order) she left and was back in New York before Christmas. I got fired from my job after this as well. So my life was terrible at this point. Fast forward to the 9th of January. She FaceTimes me crying. Ugly crying. She had slept with a guy and came to me because I had been her comfort the past 3.5 years. That was the first night I cut myself. Not to really kill myself, but to leave scars to remind me to never trust her again. I went to my care physician and she diagnosed me with Anxiety, Depression and PTSD. (Cause of my dad I’m guessing) I got put on Bupropion 150xl. I take 2 a day. Before all this he said she wanted to be friends but then turned everything back on me. It was all my fault, and I was the problem. I loved this girl. Took care of her singlehanded for 3 months while she get a job, and In school. I fixed her car twice. So now here I am writing this post. Class is hard, and I’m having trouble. I’ve tried meeting new people, but it doesn’t work. I have 7 dating apps and nothing. I am very discouraged and lonely. I miss the dogs. A few weeks ago the one we got together got ran over and she didn’t even tell me. That hurt so much. Her cousin told me at 2 am in the morning. (Beth does not have contact. She blocked me everywhere) to top it off she got her new dude to text me saying “We need to have a talk” that was the most childish thing ever. Spring break just got extended and I feel as my world is just falling apart. I have no social life. Playing video games used to be fun. Now I just find myself laying in bed scrolling through Facebook or IFunny. Even these dating apps. Nothing interests me anymore. Nothing at all. I got to my one friends house just so I’m not alone. I had to move back in with my grandma after all this. I had to move of of the house. Fridge. Washer/dryer. Hot water heater. Bed. Dishwasher. All the dishes and pots/pans I bought. Everything.

When I was depressed, I had three dreams about suicide, and each of them shook me up and I’ll never forget them. Lately, I’ve been having some signs of relapse creeping in which have been haunting me, and yesterday I had a nightmare about suicide which really messed me up.\\nIn the dream, it was a sunny day and I was outside my fraternity house where some of the other brothers were hanging out, all laughing and smiling and having a great time. There was a group of my other friends there, none of whom were in my fraternity, and I went to go hang out with them; but one of them kept making jokes about ending her life when she was serious (in real life she’s not depressed or remotely mentally ill at all so I don’t know why I conjured this up). She was saying stuff like “well when I jump off a bridge this won’t matter” and everyone was laughing, but I burst into tears in the dream because she was one of my favorite friends and I couldn’t stand the thought of her suffering. To make matters worse, I was having thoughts of suicide myself in the dream. One of the other people in the group looked at me while I was crying and asked, “what’s wrong?” and I said “because none of these people around me will be here after I end my life.”\\nThen I started thinking about the pain of suicide in the dream, thinking about the anguish that people’s parents, siblings, friends, and lovers must feel when they think they could’ve done something to stop it and they start to blame themselves. I said to myself “I hate thinking about suicide” and cried even harder, and then I “woke up” in the dream (but not actually in real life). Then after I woke up from that dream into another dream, I was suddenly in my best friend’s house traumatized from that dream I had. I was going to see my girlfriend soon, but I was still depressed from that dream and started getting mad at myself for not being happy and thinking about ending my life even though I have her. Then I actually woke up into real life and was completely shaken by what my subconscious had generated.\\nI wanted to tell my friends about the dream I had but thought it was too morbid to tell them, so I thought maybe typing it out could help me get over it.', 'text_b': None, 'label': 2}, {'guid': 4370, 'text_a': 'Desperately need help but can never seem to get results : I’m at a complete loss and have no idea where to look. My whole life people have perceived me as the funny, goofy extrovert. To be fair it’s a role I’ve given to myself, growing up I would always try to dismiss anything I found negative with a joke. Being the funny one allowed me to hide from reality and kept me happy. This worked fine throughout elementary school and made me a pretty happy kid, yet in middle school things started taking a turn for the worse. \\nFor as I can remember I’ve struggled with ADHD and anger issues. After middle school and throughout high school I started developing symptoms of anxiety, depression, insomnia, and borderline bipolarism. Im not sure if I can say I was bullied, but I have definitely been traumatized by certain friend groups and people. For example, in grades 8 and 9 I was in a toxic friend group with the older “cool kids”. Because I was the young one I was always seen as lesser and treated like I was everyone’s verbal punching bag. I would often be excluded from events or embarrassed in class because of the teasing. In grade 11 I once got confronted by an angry mob of big dudes because some guy that I beat up (in complete self defence) told someone that I was making fun of his autistic friend. This resulted in me getting circled and nearly lynched (not literally, at least I hope) for something I didn’t do. I still struggle with severe PTSD from that day. \\nI’m not fucked up all of the time, sometimes I’ll go weeks feeling like I’m on cloud 9. But no matter what it all comes back eventually. The only thing I’ve actually had diagnosed is ADHD, simply because I have no idea how to explain my other internal struggles nor do I want to. Very rarely will I tell someone that I need help. Anytime I’ve ever tried to bring them up friends or family my problems were trivialized and met with responses like “oh things will get better with time” or “just wait till you’re an adult, you’ll figure it out”. \\nWell I’m an adult now, and I sure as fuck haven’t figured it out. I struggle with the same issues I’ve had since I was a kid, and it’s made me feel so terribly isolated no matter how many friends/family I’m surrounded by. I’ve resorted to smoking weed every single day until I pass out to try and keep my problems at bay while I try to finish university. This has made me a lazy cunt that struggles to maintain what used to be my favourite hobby, bodybuilding. I’ve tried quitting a few times, however whenever I stay sober for long enough the dark stuff that’s haunted me my entire life just comes back. \\nI’ve had to quit drinking, I can’t party with my friends anymore because every time I get drunk I let out years of suppressed anger and frustration. I’ve gotten into many drunk fights, and it’s gotten to the point where I will talk shit to people twice my size without any rational thought behind it. While drunk, it’s either the version of me that loves everyone and will strike up a conversation with strangers to maybe get a laugh or some new friends, or it’s the version of me that is a complete asshole and wants to beat the shit out of anyone that gives even the slightest indication that they want to fight. This is why I ended up loving weed so much, when I’m baked I’m the nice version of myself that I recognize from when I was kid. Fuck I wish I could go back to my childhood.\\nI don’t blame people for not understanding, I can never communicate it properly. Every time I’ve met with my psychiatrist it’s like I’m describing a completely different issue, I often times over exaggerate or under exaggerate certain symptoms for literally no reason, it’s like I just panic and lie whenever someone try’s to get me to open up. Because of this inconsistency lots of people just assume I’m full of shit all the time and I’ve definitely lost credibility on certain subjects. I’m only 19 years old, and I’m starting to reach my breaking point. I don’t know what is causing all of this, but there is nothing I want more than to feel consistently normal. \\nIf you were to see me in public, you wouldn’t guess any of this. You would see a nice, funny extrovert that has a wonderful family, good friends and gets good grades. Behind that mask is a lonely cunt that doesn’t fully understand other people and sure as fuck doesn’t understand himself.

I hate living. I hate looking in front of the mirror everyday and looking at my reflection. I delusionally quit computer science when I realized even if I make 150k a year it wouldn't be enough to support my family let alone the people in my neighborhood. I don't know, I guess over time you start to sympathize with the kid who has crackhead parents and realize, there is an unlikely chance he is going down an educated path. Just by observing those people with same scenario my age. I look at homeless people and wonder the same thing. They are put on pills that keep them on streets because pharmacies is just a business. In my city the people prescribing them just need money and a job. The thing I hate most about myself too is the fact I feel sorry for myself, there are kids in the middle East who get drugged from a young age and used for militaristic purposes. There is the camps in China where people are getting raped, kids who are being kidnapped and used for organ harvesting and kept alive. People say the world is getting better but it feels blind. I know people in Canada like to seek themselves as good, but is buying a phone not technically supporting those evil acts. The truth is those phones are being made by underpaid workers in a different country.  There's also so many other issues. Like a lot of people hate on hip hop music and the hypersexuality and hypercriminalty aspect of it, but there's so many more layers to that. These artist who need to comply to middle class market since middle class kids bring in revenue from buying tickets to shows. They get all the blame for that type of music but the reality is they make it for the industry. If middle class kids liked bubbly music I'm a 100% certain these poor artist would start making music like that. The truth is in poor areas the reality is if you choose to go to school, you won't be able to support your familly so the two paths that do make enough money is selling drugs, or making music and blowing up. The other sad truth is 1 in some big number artist make it. Look at all those artist, most of the poor ones were criminals or lived a gangster lifestyle (in this generation). A lot of these artist don't want to do that. NBA youngboy (jail, drugs, etc), the Kelly (killed best friend), Kodak black (drugs, jail, etc).  \\nWhy don't they just do pop? No resources, not enough time to work a 8 hour job, sing, create, etc. A lot of pop artist have big teams. If your a female in a poor area you're even more screwed. Most famous female artist in the industry went to music schools, were rich, and had connections. Their isn't much opportunity for them that can support their love ones. We see those who succeeded but not many of those who didn't. A lot of them did put work in too. My whole point is humans are corrupt and some people get the back end of it while others get built up from those people. The pharmacies, the organ harvesters, etc. Even everyday people are, we just been dehumanized to it, or are just blind to their actions. Anyways I ask myself, why should you live if you're just at the bottom? Hope? We see all these inspirational stories but the reality is most people don't end up like that. You have to pick a poison. In the world we live in it's getting harder and harder for people to make it out. Kids getting drugged at young age, underpaid workers with no education and no one willing to hand that out. Homeless people, being put into a loop, and from what I've seen, a lot of ignorant people judging them. Why should I live, work 5 times harder, sacrifice all of my free time, just to end up having the same job as the other guy? Also, I mentioned I hate myself even more for being ungrateful cause some people have less, but why? Why should that be okay? Why is that something you can tell someone. Be grateful, someone out there has it way worse. I disagree with telling someone that. There should be a fine line. I think kids shouldn't get drugged from a young age and turned into tools. Why is suicide looked down upon is what I'm asking. Hell, should I tell that homeless person to have hope? Statistically speaking, things aren't getting better for him. Enjoy the little things. This is where I am just being a brat, but it's hard to enjoy those things when I don't know if I'm getting food tommorow, and then I see someone on social media skiing down a mountain with no cares in the world. Humans are competitive by nature and being at the bottom you don't have many sense of achievement especially in the era we live in. It kinda gets to you. What is the point of living? Friends and family I never see cause we all have our own schedules and are super busy busting our asses off? Also people do care they just to social media to help. Reality is that doesn't help. We had a protest in my city recently and the way protesting in this era works is you make a post on your page. You can't get violent or cause disruption or else you get arrested. Therefore you just watch them as they do the thing you don't want. It seems like half the time people bring awareness to stuff it's cause it's trendy too. I saw so many post on the Australian fires, but a few on the Uighur camps in China. I saw millions mourn the death of a rapper, but minimal awareness to other things that are way worse cause it isn't trendy. Respect to black live matters but but what happens if you do that with another race? It doesn't work. Some races are getting fucked over way harder in this day and age. No one puts their hand up cause it's not a trendy movement, not to say the movements they support aren't important. 8.4 mill on black lives and less than 100000 combined on Mexican and brown. Sorry random rants in random order. Lots to get off my chest. What's the point of living. I'm a brown guy from a poor neighbourhood so just being a famous artist would be way harder just cause of my colour. I looked it up, and found only 1 brown person in a list of upcoming artist and actors list. The rest were predominantly white or black. Statistically speaking, woman are less interested in brown guys. Even brown chicks guys from other races. I'd say a lack of media portrayal has a doing in that. The other options aren't so friendly either. Go to school and not support my family. Bust my ass off, start a business and make enough money but at that point my chances are the same in music. What's the point in living?

I only use it to share information rather than show-off my fake good life or see anyone’s fake good life.\\n3. Leave toxic people, and YES, most people are toxic to you especially if you are eccentric person. And give up on people, give up on hoping someone will magically show up and fix all your problems. \\n4. A healthy life style is very important to keep you energy level up. Eat good, sleep good, be active.\\n5. Search on some higher purpose of life. I give up finding any happiness from human connection. I never felt love from a man before, never in a relationship, disappoint by people again again and again. Then I stick my interests to machine, I study computer science and I am fascinated by technology. I develop a religious zealous of what a future world I want to create or envisioned: i want to create something amazing, something redefining current human social structure. A world where outcast like me can feel happy and comfortable to live in. A world without crowd stupidity and adheres to the mercy of humanity, a world without division, bullying and misunderstanding.

Not all people are ignorant. I will feel delighted to see when some people act differently from my calculation.

They were all based off my looks and nothing more. \\nGuys with girlfriends were a lot of times the worst, if they saw me talking to their boyfriends, they’d get super jealous, if we’re studying for a test together, they assumed I’m trying to take their man. I would never try to get in between someone’s relationship and if your boyfriend decides to flirt with me, I’ll do my best to make him know I’m not interested but I’m not responsible for his actions so don’t get upset at me. And a lot of girls would just seem to be in competition with me and I’m not. Or some of them would make it seem as if they are worshiping me and it just felt weird. \\nThen things got worst how people assumed things I get stuff based off my looks strictly. Like I’m not going to lie people have given me special treatment but I’ve never requested it and I’ve never depended on it, I’ve always been dedicated to working hard and earning what I want. I remember my sophomore year I was taking a Number Theory class which is harder than it sounds. I took a test, the mean score was about a 55% and I got a 91% and a girl claimed I got a high grade based of my looks. I studied hard for that, I tried to get a group together where she was invited and she declined. On my test, the problems were done correctly, and she claimed it was based of my looks. That was just so hurtful. \\nAs time went on it just bothered, and I became depressed off of it based off the idea that I did not think I could ever find love. I’m a start girl, pretty but I felt like I could not find a guy to talk to where the topic of sex or my boobs did not come up before a couple conversions. It just felt like that’s all guys saw me for. And I know looks fade as time go, I don’t want a guy who just has sex with me then goes and brags to his friends, or realizes that I won’t always be this pretty and move on to another girl eventually. And I could not talk to people. Girls would always say they wish they had that as a problem, and guys would always “listen” and the next week they’re asking for pictures of my breast. And my family didn’t make things better either always asking why I don’t have a boyfriend, it must be so easy for me. \\nThat just always bothered me and brought me down significantly, I was never in a great state of depression but it was something that was just there and it was hard to talk to someone. That was something that bothered me until last year. \\nOne day my car battery died at school and a friend and I were outside for about thirty minutes trying to jumpstart it. But she drove a weird Jeep and you had to unscrew stuff to get to the battery so we were there for a while. Eventually this guy came but and asked if we needed help, he has a portable battery in his car. I assumed he was just another guy trying to get into my pants. But that was not the case. He came over and actually helped, he knew what he was doing. We talked a bit afterwards, found out we used to live in the same area. He’s a volunteer firefighter in the town over now and he’s an economics major with a math minor. Then he said he had to go, he didn’t get my name or ask for my Snapchat like most guys do. \\nThere was just something about him, the way he was super kind to do this gesture for me without expecting nothing in return. I was somewhat attracted to him. Luckily, I started seeing him on campus all the time and we would wave to each other. Eventually I got brave enough to go and talk to him and I did. We became friends and started talking a lot, he was super kind, funny and a weird sense of charisma. And I started realizing just how handsome he was along with his super muscular bodies. One thing led to another and we have been dating since then. This man treat me right, makes me so happy, makes me feel cared for and for much more than my body. Every conversation is not just about sex, he actually listen to me. Asks about my dreams and aspirations and I feel so comfortable around him. Every once in a while I do catch his eye wandering away but with him, I do enjoy it and sometimes his eyes would stay there a bit longer after I catch him haha. His complements mean much more to me, because they feel genuine and much more than something to get into my pants. I love this guy a lot, and I generally don’t advocate for getting into relationships to fix depression. But I’m this specific case it helped me, I’m so happy with him and I could see us lasting and I would like it to and he feels the same.

I’ve also gotten past that and have made amazing progress in my mental health journey. I also recognize that everyone has different struggles and I’m not trying to downplay anything you might be going through.

I was that weird kid who mapped out my entire life, and before the internet had a wealth of information on that. I talked to vets, I read every SINGLE book I could find, it was my thing. I was that kid that people would bring their animals to look at, and I could tell them a rough diagnosis, and what kinds of tests they would need to do at the clinic, so they\\'d be mentally prepared for the bill. Vet school was out, but I had researched veterinary tech programs while I was a teacher: the problem was that they were all full-time programs during the day. But hey, that was no longer a problem! I burst into tears when I realized that I HAD figured out why I needed to stay: I had shlumped into my teaching career because my depression told me I had to. I applied for the only accredited school in my city while we were docked in Tokyo Bay. (Husband, who didn\\'t know me back when I was Weird Animal Girl, thought this was impulsive and out of nowhere. It wasn\\'t until the next morning, when we called my mom, that he realized it wasn\\'t impulse. Mom said \"oh, thank God, that\\'s what I\\'ve been waiting to hear for years.\" She told my grandpa and his response was \"It\\'s about damn time!!\" He had to realized that oh, no. This was a huge part of my personality he hadn\\'t noticed)\\nI started classes three weeks later. Every day, I am JAZZED to get to go to class, and even more excited to do the one thing I\\'ve always wanted. For the first time since I went into teaching, way back in 2009, I feel hope. I still struggle with depression, obviously, especially because I\\'ve lapsed on therapy (fricking copays)...but I maybe found the thing that will keep me going.\\nBeing admitted really did end my teaching career forever.', 'text_b': None, 'label': 2}, {'guid': 4479, 'text_a': \"Complete apathy? : Uh is this normal?
